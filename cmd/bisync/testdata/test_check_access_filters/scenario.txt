test check-access-filters
# Test Check Access construction of select/exclude filters for the SCE_TEST files.
# NOTE: Include Other tests may result in listing diffs due to rclone processing order change. False fail.
#
# Tests are done in two phases:
#  - EXCLUDE OTHER tests check that SCE_TEST files are only found in the explicitly included directories
#  - INCLUDE OTHER tesss check that SCE_TEST files are found in all directories not explicitly excluded
#
# Each phase checks that:
#  - missing SCE_TEST files in don't care directories don't cause failures
#  - missing SCE_TEST files in care directories do cause failures
