.SH rclone serve ftp
Serve remote:path over FTP.
Run a basic FTP server to serve a remote over FTP protocol.
This can be viewed with a FTP client or you can make a remote of type
FTP to read and write it.
.SS Server options
Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, e.g.
--addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.
.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can set a single username and password with the --user and --pass
flags.
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[V]--auth-proxy /path/to/program\f[R] then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then
are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[V]--auth-proxy\f[R] and
\f[V]--authorized-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[V]--auth-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[aq]s job is to take a \f[V]user\f[R] and \f[V]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[aq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]_root\f[R] - root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]_obscure\f[R] - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
{
  \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
  \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
  \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
  \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
  \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
  \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
  \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
  \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
  \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
  \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[V]user\f[R] and \f[V]pass\f[R]/\f[V]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[V]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[V]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[V]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[V]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[V]user\f[R] be \f[V]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[V]host\f[R] to \f[V]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[V]user\f[R].
For security you\[aq]d probably want to restrict the \f[V]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[V]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[aq]t use \f[V]pass\f[R] or \f[V]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[aq]s password or public-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.
.IP

.SH rclone serve http
Serve the remote over HTTP.
Run a basic web server to serve a remote over HTTP.
This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a remote of type
http read from it.
.PP
You can use the filter flags (e.g.
\f[V]--include\f[R], \f[V]--exclude\f[R]) to control what is served.
.PP
The server will log errors.
Use \f[V]-v\f[R] to see access logs.
.PP
\f[V]--bwlimit\f[R] will be respected for file transfers.
Use \f[V]--stats\f[R] to control the stats printing.
Use \f[V]--addr\f[R] to specify which IP address and port the server
should listen on, eg \f[V]--addr 1.2.3.4:8000\f[R] or
\f[V]--addr :8080\f[R] to listen to all IPs.
If you set \f[V]--addr\f[R] to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP
address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for
info.
.PP
You can use a unix socket by setting the url to
\f[V]unix:///path/to/socket\f[R] or just by using an absolute path name.
.PP
\f[V]--addr\f[R] may be repeated to listen on multiple
IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to
accomplish the same.
.PP
\f[V]--server-read-timeout\f[R] and \f[V]--server-write-timeout\f[R] can
be used to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\f[V]--max-header-bytes\f[R] controls the maximum number of bytes the
server will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R] controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] then rclone would
serve from a URL starting with \[dq]/rclone/\[dq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[dq]/\[dq] on
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R], so \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]rclone\[dq]\f[R],
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] and
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone/\[dq]\f[R] are all treated identically.
.PP
\f[V]--disable-zip\f[R] may be set to disable the zipping download
option.
.SS TLS (SSL)
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \f[V]--cert\f[R] and \f[V]--key\f[R] flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] also.
.PP
\f[V]--cert\f[R] must be set to the path of a file containing either a
PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA
certificate.
\f[V]--key\f[R] must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded
private key.
If setting \f[V]--client-ca\f[R], it should be set to the path of a file
with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.
.PP
\f[V]--min-tls-version\f[R] is minimum TLS version that is acceptable.
Valid values are \[dq]tls1.0\[dq], \[dq]tls1.1\[dq], \[dq]tls1.2\[dq]
and \[dq]tls1.3\[dq] (default \[dq]tls1.0\[dq]).
.SS Socket activation
.PP
Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen
to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any
arguments passed by \f[V]--addr\f[R]).
.PP
This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described
in
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html>.
.PP
Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the
\f[V]systemd-socket-activate\f[R]command
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000
over TCP.
.SS Template
.PP
\f[V]--template\f[R] allows a user to specify a custom markup template
for HTTP and WebDAV serve functions.
The server exports the following markup to be used within the template
to server pages:
.PP

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \f[V]--user\f[R] and
\f[V]--pass\f[R] flags.
.PP
Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and
use the username provided in the configured header with
\f[V]--user-from-header\f[R] (e.g.,
\f[V]--user-from-header=x-remote-user\f[R]).
Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as
misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.
.PP
If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and
client certificates are required by the \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] flag
passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be
considered as the username.
.PP
Use \f[V]--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R] to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \f[V]--realm\f[R] to set the authentication realm.

Use \f[V]--salt\f[R] to change the password hashing salt from the
default.

.SH rclone serve nfs
Serve the remote as an NFS mount
Create an NFS server that serves the given remote over the network.
This implements an NFSv3 server to serve any rclone remote via NFS.
The primary purpose for this command is to enable the mount
command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) on recent macOS
versions where installing FUSE is very cumbersome.
This server does not implement any authentication so any client will be
able to access the data.
To limit access, you can use \f[V]serve nfs\f[R] on the loopback address
or rely on secure tunnels (such as SSH) or use firewalling.
For this reason, by default, a random TCP port is chosen and the
loopback interface is used for the listening address by default; meaning
that it is only available to the local machine.
If you want other machines to access the NFS mount over local network,
you need to specify the listening address and port using the
\f[V]--addr\f[R] flag.
Modifying files through the NFS protocol requires VFS caching.
Usually you will need to specify \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] in order to
be able to write to the mountpoint (\f[V]full\f[R] is recommended).
If you don\[aq]t specify VFS cache mode, the mount will be read-only.
\f[V]--nfs-cache-type\f[R] controls the type of the NFS handle cache.
By default this is \f[V]memory\f[R] where new handles will be randomly
allocated when needed.
These are stored in memory.
If the server is restarted the handle cache will be lost and connected
NFS clients will get stale handle errors.
\f[V]--nfs-cache-type disk\f[R] uses an on disk NFS handle cache.
Rclone hashes the path of the object and stores it in a file named after
the hash.
These hashes are stored on disk the directory controlled by
\f[V]--cache-dir\f[R] or the exact directory may be specified with
\f[V]--nfs-cache-dir\f[R].
Using this means that the NFS server can be restarted at will without
affecting the connected clients.
\f[V]--nfs-cache-type symlink\f[R] is similar to
\f[V]--nfs-cache-type disk\f[R] in that it uses an on disk cache, but
the cache entries are held as symlinks.
Rclone will use the handle of the underlying file as the NFS handle
which improves performance.
This sort of cache can\[aq]t be backed up and restored as the underlying
handles will change.
This is Linux only.
It requires running rclone as root or with
\f[V]CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH\f[R].
You can run rclone with this extra permission by doing this to the
rclone binary
\f[V]sudo setcap cap_dac_read_search+ep /path/to/rclone\f[R].
\f[V]--nfs-cache-handle-limit\f[R] controls the maximum number of cached
NFS handles stored by the caching handler.
This should not be set too low or you may experience errors when trying
to access files.
The default is \f[V]1000000\f[R], but consider lowering this limit if
the server\[aq]s system resource usage causes problems.
This is only used by the \f[V]memory\f[R] type cache.
To serve NFS over the network use following command:
rclone serve nfs remote: --addr 0.0.0.0:$PORT --vfs-cache-mode=full
This specifies a port that can be used in the mount command.
To mount the server under Linux/macOS, use the following command:
mount -t nfs -o port=$PORT,mountport=$PORT,tcp $HOSTNAME:/ path/to/mountpoint
Where \f[V]$PORT\f[R] is the same port number used in the
\f[V]serve nfs\f[R] command and \f[V]$HOSTNAME\f[R] is the network
address of the machine that \f[V]serve nfs\f[R] was run on.
If \f[V]--vfs-metadata-extension\f[R] is in use then for the
\f[V]--nfs-cache-type disk\f[R] and \f[V]--nfs-cache-type cache\f[R] the
metadata files will have the file handle of their parent file suffixed
with \f[V]0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01\f[R].
This means they can be looked up directly from the parent file handle is
desired.
This command is only available on Unix platforms.
rclone serve nfs remote:path [flags]
      --addr string                            IPaddress:Port or :Port to bind server to

      --nfs-cache-dir string                   The directory the NFS handle cache will use if set
      --nfs-cache-handle-limit int             max file handles cached simultaneously (min 5) (default 1000000)

.SH rclone serve restic
Serve the remote for restic\[aq]s REST API.
Run a basic web server to serve a remote over restic\[aq]s REST backend
API over HTTP.
This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for cloud
providers that restic does not support directly.
Restic (https://restic.net/) is a command-line program for doing
backups.
The server will log errors.
Use -v to see access logs.
\f[V]--bwlimit\f[R] will be respected for file transfers.
Use \f[V]--stats\f[R] to control the stats printing.
.SS Setting up rclone for use by restic
First set up a remote for your chosen cloud
provider (https://rclone.org/docs/#configure).
Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
\[dq]rclone lsd remote:\[dq].
You may have called the remote something other than \[dq]remote:\[dq] -
just substitute whatever you called it in the following instructions.
Now start the rclone restic server
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone serve restic -v remote:backup
\f[R]
.fi
Where you can replace \[dq]backup\[dq] in the above by whatever path in
the remote you wish to use.
By default this will serve on \[dq]localhost:8080\[dq] you can change
this with use of the \f[V]--addr\f[R] flag.
You might wish to start this server on boot.
Adding \f[V]--cache-objects=false\f[R] will cause rclone to stop caching
objects returned from the List call.
Caching is normally desirable as it speeds up downloading objects, saves
transactions and uses very little memory.
.SS Setting up restic to use rclone
.PP
Now you can follow the restic
instructions (http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server)
on setting up restic.
.PP
Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.
.PP
For the example above you will want to use
\[dq]http://localhost:8080/\[dq] as the URL for the REST server.
.PP
For example:
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
$ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
$ restic init
created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
irrecoverably lost.
$ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
[0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
duration: 0:00
snapshot 45c8fdd8 saved
.SS Multiple repositories
Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories.
Do this by adding a directory name or path after the URL.
Note that these \f[B]must\f[R] end with /.
Eg
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
# backup user1 stuff
$ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
# backup user2 stuff
.SS Private repositories
The\f[V]--private-repos\f[R] flag can be used to limit users to
repositories starting with a path of \f[V]/<username>/\f[R].
.SS Server options
Use \f[V]--addr\f[R] to specify which IP address and port the server
should listen on, eg \f[V]--addr 1.2.3.4:8000\f[R] or
\f[V]--addr :8080\f[R] to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
If you set \f[V]--addr\f[R] to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP
address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for
info.
You can use a unix socket by setting the url to
\f[V]unix:///path/to/socket\f[R] or just by using an absolute path name.
\f[V]--addr\f[R] may be repeated to listen on multiple
IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to
accomplish the same.
\f[V]--server-read-timeout\f[R] and \f[V]--server-write-timeout\f[R] can
be used to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
\f[V]--max-header-bytes\f[R] controls the maximum number of bytes the
server will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R] controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] then rclone would
serve from a URL starting with \[dq]/rclone/\[dq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[dq]/\[dq] on
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R], so \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]rclone\[dq]\f[R],
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] and
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone/\[dq]\f[R] are all treated identically.
.PP
\f[V]--disable-zip\f[R] may be set to disable the zipping download
option.
.SS TLS (SSL)
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \f[V]--cert\f[R] and \f[V]--key\f[R] flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] also.
.PP
\f[V]--cert\f[R] must be set to the path of a file containing either a
PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA
certificate.
\f[V]--key\f[R] must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded
private key.
If setting \f[V]--client-ca\f[R], it should be set to the path of a file
with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.
.PP
\f[V]--min-tls-version\f[R] is minimum TLS version that is acceptable.
Valid values are \[dq]tls1.0\[dq], \[dq]tls1.1\[dq], \[dq]tls1.2\[dq]
and \[dq]tls1.3\[dq] (default \[dq]tls1.0\[dq]).
.SS Socket activation
.PP
Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen
to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any
arguments passed by \f[V]--addr\f[R]).
.PP
This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described
in
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html>.
.PP
Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the
\f[V]systemd-socket-activate\f[R]command
systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve
This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000
over TCP.
.SS Authentication
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \f[V]--user\f[R] and
\f[V]--pass\f[R] flags.
.PP
Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and
use the username provided in the configured header with
\f[V]--user-from-header\f[R] (e.g.,
\f[V]--user-from-header=x-remote-user\f[R]).
Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as
misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.
.PP
If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and
client certificates are required by the \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] flag
passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be
considered as the username.
.PP
Use \f[V]--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R] to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \f[V]--realm\f[R] to set the authentication realm.
.PP
Use \f[V]--salt\f[R] to change the password hashing salt from the
default.

.SS See Also
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) - Serve a
remote over a protocol.
.SH rclone serve s3
Serve remote:path over s3.
.SS Synopsis
\f[V]serve s3\f[R] implements a basic s3 server that serves a remote via
s3.
This can be viewed with an s3 client, or you can make an s3 type
remote (https://rclone.org/s3/) to read and write to it with rclone.
\f[V]serve s3\f[R] is considered \f[B]Experimental\f[R] so use with
care.
S3 server supports Signature Version 4 authentication.
Just use \f[V]--auth-key accessKey,secretKey\f[R] and set the
\f[V]Authorization\f[R] header correctly in the request.
(See the AWS
docs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)).
\f[V]--auth-key\f[R] can be repeated for multiple auth pairs.
If \f[V]--auth-key\f[R] is not provided then \f[V]serve s3\f[R] will
allow anonymous access.
Please note that some clients may require HTTPS endpoints.
See the SSL docs for more information.
.PP
This command uses the VFS directory cache.
All the functionality will work with \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode off\f[R].
Using \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode full\f[R] (or \f[V]writes\f[R]) can be used
to cache objects locally to improve performance.
.PP
Use \f[V]--force-path-style=false\f[R] if you want to use the bucket
name as a part of the hostname (such as mybucket.local)
.PP
Use \f[V]--etag-hash\f[R] if you want to change the hash uses for the
\f[V]ETag\f[R].
Note that using anything other than \f[V]MD5\f[R] (the default) is
likely to cause problems for S3 clients which rely on the Etag being the
MD5.
.SS Quickstart
.PP
For a simple set up, to serve \f[V]remote:path\f[R] over s3, run the
server like this:
rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY remote:path
For example, to use a simple folder in the filesystem, run the server
with a command like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone serve s3 --auth-key ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY local:/path/to/folder
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[V]rclone.conf\f[R] for the server could look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[local]
type = local
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[V]local\f[R] configuration is optional though.
If you run the server with a \f[V]remote:path\f[R] like
\f[V]/path/to/folder\f[R] (without the \f[V]local:\f[R] prefix and
without an \f[V]rclone.conf\f[R] file), rclone will fall back to a
default configuration, which will be visible as a warning in the logs.
But it will run nonetheless.
.PP
This will be compatible with an rclone (client) remote configuration
which is defined like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[serves3]
type = s3
provider = Rclone
endpoint = http://127.0.0.1:8080/
access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_ID
secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
use_multipart_uploads = false
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that setting \f[V]use_multipart_uploads = false\f[R] is to work
around a bug which will be fixed in due course.
.SS Bugs
.PP
When uploading multipart files \f[V]serve s3\f[R] holds all the parts in
memory (see #7453 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7453)).
This is a limitaton of the library rclone uses for serving S3 and will
hopefully be fixed at some point.
.PP
Multipart server side copies do not work (see
#7454 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/7454)).
These take a very long time and eventually fail.
The default threshold for multipart server side copies is 5G which is
the maximum it can be, so files above this side will fail to be server
side copied.
.PP
For a current list of \f[V]serve s3\f[R] bugs see the serve
s3 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/labels/serve%20s3) bug category on
GitHub.
.SS Limitations
.PP
\f[V]serve s3\f[R] will treat all directories in the root as buckets and
ignore all files in the root.
You can use \f[V]CreateBucket\f[R] to create folders under the root, but
you can\[aq]t create empty folders under other folders not in the root.
.PP
When using \f[V]PutObject\f[R] or \f[V]DeleteObject\f[R], rclone will
automatically create or clean up empty folders.
If you don\[aq]t want to clean up empty folders automatically, use
\f[V]--no-cleanup\f[R].
.PP
When using \f[V]ListObjects\f[R], rclone will use \f[V]/\f[R] when the
delimiter is empty.
This reduces backend requests with no effect on most operations, but if
the delimiter is something other than \f[V]/\f[R] and empty, rclone will
do a full recursive search of the backend, which can take some time.
.PP
Versioning is not currently supported.
.PP
Metadata will only be saved in memory other than the rclone
\f[V]mtime\f[R] metadata which will be set as the modification time of
the file.
.SS Supported operations
.PP
\f[V]serve s3\f[R] currently supports the following operations.

.PP
Other operations will return error \f[V]Unimplemented\f[R].
.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \f[V]--user\f[R] and
\f[V]--pass\f[R] flags.
.PP
Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and
use the username provided in the configured header with
\f[V]--user-from-header\f[R] (e.g.,
\f[V]--user-from-header=x-remote-user\f[R]).
Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as
misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.
.PP
If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and
client certificates are required by the \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] flag
passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be
considered as the username.
.PP
Use \f[V]--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R] to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
.PP
Use \f[V]--realm\f[R] to set the authentication realm.
.PP
Use \f[V]--salt\f[R] to change the password hashing salt from the
default.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \f[V]--addr\f[R] to specify which IP address and port the server
should listen on, eg \f[V]--addr 1.2.3.4:8000\f[R] or
\f[V]--addr :8080\f[R] to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \f[V]--addr\f[R] to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP
address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for
info.
.PP
You can use a unix socket by setting the url to
\f[V]unix:///path/to/socket\f[R] or just by using an absolute path name.
.PP
\f[V]--addr\f[R] may be repeated to listen on multiple
IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to
accomplish the same.
.PP
\f[V]--server-read-timeout\f[R] and \f[V]--server-write-timeout\f[R] can
be used to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\f[V]--max-header-bytes\f[R] controls the maximum number of bytes the
server will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R] controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] then rclone would
serve from a URL starting with \[dq]/rclone/\[dq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[dq]/\[dq] on
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R], so \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]rclone\[dq]\f[R],
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] and
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone/\[dq]\f[R] are all treated identically.
.PP
\f[V]--disable-zip\f[R] may be set to disable the zipping download
option.
.SS TLS (SSL)
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \f[V]--cert\f[R] and \f[V]--key\f[R] flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] also.
.PP
\f[V]--cert\f[R] must be set to the path of a file containing either a
PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA
certificate.
\f[V]--key\f[R] must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded
private key.
If setting \f[V]--client-ca\f[R], it should be set to the path of a file
with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.
.PP
\f[V]--min-tls-version\f[R] is minimum TLS version that is acceptable.
Valid values are \[dq]tls1.0\[dq], \[dq]tls1.1\[dq], \[dq]tls1.2\[dq]
and \[dq]tls1.3\[dq] (default \[dq]tls1.0\[dq]).
.SS Socket activation
.PP
Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen
to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any
arguments passed by \f[V]--addr\f[R]).
.PP
This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described
in
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html>.
.PP
Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the
\f[V]systemd-socket-activate\f[R]command
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000
over TCP.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
.PP
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
.PP
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
.PP
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[V]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web interface
or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once the directory
cache expires if the backend configured does not support polling for
changes.
If the backend supports polling, changes will be picked up within the
polling interval.
.PP
You can send a \f[V]SIGHUP\f[R] signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or individual files or directories:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir
\f[R]
.fi
.SS VFS File Buffering
.PP
The \f[V]--buffer-size\f[R] flag determines the amount of memory, that
will be used to buffer data in advance.
.PP
Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times.
The buffered data is bound to one open file and won\[aq]t be shared.
.PP
This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.
The buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read.
If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be used.
.PP
The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
\f[V]--buffer-size * open files\f[R].
.SS VFS File Caching
.PP
These flags control the VFS file caching options.
File caching is necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a
normal file system.
It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.
.PP
For example you\[aq]ll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read
and write simultaneously to a file.
See below for more details.
.PP
Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    --cache-dir string                     Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode             Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration           Max time since last access of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix        Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-min-free-space SizeSuffix  Target minimum free space on the disk containing the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration     Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration              Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If run with \f[V]-vv\f[R] rclone will print the location of the file
cache.
The files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent
but can be controlled with \f[V]--cache-dir\f[R] or setting the
appropriate environment variable.
.PP
The cache has 4 different modes selected by \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R].
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost
of using disk space.
.PP
Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
and if they haven\[aq]t been accessed for \f[V]--vfs-write-back\f[R]

Run an SFTP server to serve a remote over SFTP.
This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of type
sftp to use with it.
You can use the filter flags (e.g.
\f[V]--include\f[R], \f[V]--exclude\f[R]) to control what is served.
.PP
The server will respond to a small number of shell commands, mainly
md5sum, sha1sum and df, which enable it to provide support for checksums
and the about feature when accessed from an sftp remote.
.PP
Note that this server uses standard 32 KiB packet payload size, which
means you must not configure the client to expect anything else, e.g.
with the chunk_size (https://rclone.org/sftp/#sftp-chunk-size) option on
an sftp remote.
Use \f[V]-v\f[R] to see access logs.
You must provide some means of authentication, either with
\f[V]--user\f[R]/\f[V]--pass\f[R], an authorized keys file (specify
location with \f[V]--authorized-keys\f[R] - the default is the same as
ssh), an \f[V]--auth-proxy\f[R], or set the \f[V]--no-auth\f[R] flag for
no authentication when logging in.
If you don\[aq]t supply a host \f[V]--key\f[R] then rclone will generate
rsa, ecdsa and ed25519 variants, and cache them for later use in
rclone\[aq]s cache directory (see \f[V]rclone help flags cache-dir\f[R])
in the \[dq]serve-sftp\[dq] directory.
By default the server binds to localhost:2022 - if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply \f[V]--addr :2022\f[R] for example.
.PP
This also supports being run with socket activation, in which case it
will listen on the first passed FD.
It can be configured with .socket and .service unit files as described
in
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.socket.html>.
.PP
Socket activation can be tested ad-hoc with the
\f[V]systemd-socket-activate\f[R]command:
systemd-socket-activate -l 2222 -- rclone serve sftp :local:vfs/
This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 2222
over TCP.
Note that the default of \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode off\f[R] is fine for the
rclone sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.
If \f[V]--stdio\f[R] is specified, rclone will serve SFTP over stdio,
which can be used with sshd via \[ti]/.ssh/authorized_keys, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
restrict,command=\[dq]rclone serve sftp --stdio ./photos\[dq] ssh-rsa ...
\f[R]
.fi
On the client you need to set \f[V]--transfers 1\f[R] when using
\f[V]--stdio\f[R].
Otherwise multiple instances of the rclone server are started by OpenSSH
which can lead to \[dq]corrupted on transfer\[dq] errors.
This is the case because the client chooses indiscriminately which
server to send commands to while the servers all have different views of
the state of the filing system.
The \[dq]restrict\[dq] in authorized_keys prevents SHA1SUMs and MD5SUMs
from being used.
Omitting \[dq]restrict\[dq] and using \f[V]--sftp-path-override\f[R] to
enable checksumming is possible but less secure and you could use the
SFTP server provided by OpenSSH in this case.
.SS VFS - Virtual File System
This command uses the VFS layer.
This adapts the cloud storage objects that rclone uses into something
which looks much more like a disk filing system.
Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren\[aq]t like disk
files - you can\[aq]t extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that.
Because there is no one right way of doing this there are various
options explained below.
The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info about
files and directories (but not the data) in memory.
.SS VFS Directory Cache
.PP
Using the \f[V]--dir-cache-time\f[R] flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend.
Changes made through the VFS will appear immediately or invalidate the
cache.
.SS Auth Proxy
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[V]--auth-proxy /path/to/program\f[R] then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then
are used to authenticate incoming requests.
This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
.PP
\f[B]PLEASE NOTE:\f[R] \f[V]--auth-proxy\f[R] and
\f[V]--authorized-keys\f[R] cannot be used together, if
\f[V]--auth-proxy\f[R] is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.
.PP
There is an example program
bin/test_proxy.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.
.PP
The program\[aq]s job is to take a \f[V]user\f[R] and \f[V]pass\f[R] on
the input and turn those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON
format.
This config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but
it won\[aq]t use configuration from environment variables or command
line options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.
.PP
This config generated must have this extra parameter
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]_root\f[R] - root to use for the backend
.PP
And it may have this parameter
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]_obscure\f[R] - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure
.PP
If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
  \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
  \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
  \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
  \[dq]public_key\[dq]: \[dq]AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And as an example return this on STDOUT
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
  \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
  \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
  \[dq]_obscure\[dq]: \[dq]pass\[dq],
  \[dq]user\[dq]: \[dq]me\[dq],
  \[dq]pass\[dq]: \[dq]mypassword\[dq],
  \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]sftp.example.com\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
\f[V]user\f[R] and \f[V]pass\f[R]/\f[V]public_key\f[R] returned in the
output to the host given.
Note that since \f[V]_obscure\f[R] is set to \f[V]pass\f[R], rclone will
obscure the \f[V]pass\f[R] parameter before creating the backend (which
is required for sftp backends).
.PP
The program can manipulate the supplied \f[V]user\f[R] in any way, for
example to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make
the \f[V]user\f[R] be \f[V]user\[at]example.com\f[R] and then set the
\f[V]host\f[R] to \f[V]example.com\f[R] in the output and the user to
\f[V]user\f[R].
For security you\[aq]d probably want to restrict the \f[V]host\f[R] to a
limited list.
.PP
Note that an internal cache is keyed on \f[V]user\f[R] so only use that
for configuration, don\[aq]t use \f[V]pass\f[R] or \f[V]public_key\f[R].
This also means that if a user\[aq]s password or public-key is changed
the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it takes
effect.
.PP
This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

.SH rclone serve webdav
Serve remote:path over WebDAV.
Run a basic WebDAV server to serve a remote over HTTP via the WebDAV
protocol.
This can be viewed with a WebDAV client, through a web browser, or you
can make a remote of type WebDAV to read and write it.
.SS WebDAV options
.SS --etag-hash
This controls the ETag header.
Without this flag the ETag will be based on the ModTime and Size of the
object.
If this flag is set to \[dq]auto\[dq] then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as
\[dq]MD5\[dq] or \[dq]SHA-1\[dq].
Use the hashsum (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_hashsum/) command to
see the full list.
.SS Access WebDAV on Windows
WebDAV shared folder can be mapped as a drive on Windows, however the
default settings prevent it.
Windows will fail to connect to the server using insecure Basic
authentication.
It will not even display any login dialog.
Windows requires SSL / HTTPS connection to be used with Basic.
If you try to connect via Add Network Location Wizard you will get the
following error: \[dq]The folder you entered does not appear to be
valid.
Please choose another\[dq].
However, you still can connect if you set the following registry key on
a client machine:
\f[V]HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\[rs]SYSTEM\[rs]CurrentControlSet\[rs]Services\[rs]WebClient\[rs]Parameters\[rs]BasicAuthLevel\f[R]
to 2.
The BasicAuthLevel can be set to the following values:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
0 - Basic authentication disabled
1 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections only
2 - Basic authentication enabled for SSL connections and for non-SSL connections
\f[R]
.fi
If required, increase the FileSizeLimitInBytes to a higher value.
Navigate to the Services interface, then restart the WebClient service.
.SS Access Office applications on WebDAV
Navigate to following registry
\f[V]HKEY_CURRENT_USER\[rs]Software\[rs]Microsoft\[rs]Office\[rs][14.0/15.0/16.0]\[rs]Common\[rs]Internet\f[R]

.SS Serving over a unix socket
You can serve the webdav on a unix socket like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone serve webdav --addr unix:///tmp/my.socket remote:path
\f[R]
.fi
and connect to it like this using rclone and the webdav backend:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone --webdav-unix-socket /tmp/my.socket --webdav-url http://localhost lsf :webdav:
\f[R]
.fi
Note that there is no authentication on http protocol - this is expected
to be done by the permissions on the socket.
.SS Server options
.PP
Use \f[V]--addr\f[R] to specify which IP address and port the server
should listen on, eg \f[V]--addr 1.2.3.4:8000\f[R] or
\f[V]--addr :8080\f[R] to listen to all IPs.
By default it only listens on localhost.
You can use port :0 to let the OS choose an available port.
.PP
If you set \f[V]--addr\f[R] to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP
address then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for
info.
.PP
You can use a unix socket by setting the url to
\f[V]unix:///path/to/socket\f[R] or just by using an absolute path name.
.PP
\f[V]--addr\f[R] may be repeated to listen on multiple
IPs/ports/sockets.
Socket activation, described further below, can also be used to
accomplish the same.
.PP
\f[V]--server-read-timeout\f[R] and \f[V]--server-write-timeout\f[R] can
be used to control the timeouts on the server.
Note that this is the total time for a transfer.
.PP
\f[V]--max-header-bytes\f[R] controls the maximum number of bytes the
server will accept in the HTTP header.
.PP
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R] controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.
By default rclone will serve from the root.
If you used \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] then rclone would
serve from a URL starting with \[dq]/rclone/\[dq].
This is useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.
Rclone automatically inserts leading and trailing \[dq]/\[dq] on
\f[V]--baseurl\f[R], so \f[V]--baseurl \[dq]rclone\[dq]\f[R],
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone\[dq]\f[R] and
\f[V]--baseurl \[dq]/rclone/\[dq]\f[R] are all treated identically.
.PP
\f[V]--disable-zip\f[R] may be set to disable the zipping download
option.
.SS TLS (SSL)
.PP
By default this will serve over http.
If you want you can serve over https.
You will need to supply the \f[V]--cert\f[R] and \f[V]--key\f[R] flags.
If you wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need
to supply \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] also.
.PP
\f[V]--cert\f[R] must be set to the path of a file containing either a
PEM encoded certificate, or a concatenation of that with the CA
certificate.
\f[V]--key\f[R] must be set to the path of a file with the PEM encoded
private key.
If setting \f[V]--client-ca\f[R], it should be set to the path of a file
with PEM encoded client certificate authority certificates.
.PP
\f[V]--min-tls-version\f[R] is minimum TLS version that is acceptable.
Valid values are \[dq]tls1.0\[dq], \[dq]tls1.1\[dq], \[dq]tls1.2\[dq]
and \[dq]tls1.3\[dq] (default \[dq]tls1.0\[dq]).
.SS Socket activation
.PP
Instead of the listening addresses specified above, rclone will listen
to all FDs passed by the service manager, if any (and ignore any
arguments passed by \f[V]--addr\f[R]).
.PP
This allows rclone to be a socket-activated service.
\f[V]systemd-socket-activate\f[R]command
systemd-socket-activate -l 8000 -- rclone serve
This will socket-activate rclone on the first connection to port 8000
.SS Template
\f[V]--template\f[R] allows a user to specify a custom markup template
for HTTP and WebDAV serve functions.
The server exports the following markup to be used within the template
to server pages:

.SS Authentication
.PP
By default this will serve files without needing a login.
.PP
You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the \f[V]--user\f[R] and
\f[V]--pass\f[R] flags.
.PP
Alternatively, you can have the reverse proxy manage authentication and
use the username provided in the configured header with
\f[V]--user-from-header\f[R] (e.g.,
\f[V]--user-from-header=x-remote-user\f[R]).
Ensure the proxy is trusted and headers cannot be spoofed, as
misconfiguration may lead to unauthorized access.
.PP
If either of the above authentication methods is not configured and
client certificates are required by the \f[V]--client-ca\f[R] flag
passed to the server, the client certificate common name will be
considered as the username.
.PP
Use \f[V]--htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R] to provide an htpasswd file.
This is in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for
basic authentication.
Bcrypt is recommended.
.PP
To create an htpasswd file:
touch htpasswd
htpasswd -B htpasswd user
htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser
The password file can be updated while rclone is running.
Use \f[V]--realm\f[R] to set the authentication realm.
.PP
Use \f[V]--salt\f[R] to change the password hashing salt from the
default.

.SH rclone settier
Changes storage class/tier of objects in remote.
Changes storage tier or class at remote if supported.
Few cloud storage services provides different storage classes on
objects, for example AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage - Hot, Cool
and Archive, Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline
etc.
Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access
immediately.
For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes objects in
frozen state, user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool, similarly S3
to Glacier makes object inaccessible.true
You can use it to tier single object
rclone settier Cool remote:path/file
Or use rclone filters to set tier on only specific files
rclone --include \[dq]*.txt\[dq] settier Hot remote:path/dir
Or just provide remote directory and all files in directory will be
tiered

Run a speed test to the remote
.SS Synopsis
Run a speed test to the remote.
This command runs a series of uploads and downloads to the remote,
measuring and printing the speed of each test using varying file sizes
and numbers of files.
Test time can be innaccurate with small file caps and large files.
As it uses the results of an initial test to determine how many files to
use in each subsequent test.
It is recommended to use -q flag for a simpler output.
e.g.:
rclone test speed remote: -q
\f[B]NB\f[R] This command will create and delete files on the remote in
a randomly named directory which will be automatically removed on a
clean exit.
You can use the --json flag to only print the results in JSON format.

rclone test (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_test/) - Run a test
command
.SH rclone touch
Create new file or change file modification time.
.SS Synopsis
Set the modification time on file(s) as specified by remote:path to have
the current time.
If remote:path does not exist then a zero sized file will be created,
unless \f[V]--no-create\f[R] or \f[V]--recursive\f[R] is provided.
If \f[V]--recursive\f[R] is used then recursively sets the modification
time on all existing files that is found under the path.
Filters are supported, and you can test with the \f[V]--dry-run\f[R] or
the \f[V]--interactive\f[R]/\f[V]-i\f[R] flag.
This will touch \f[V]--transfers\f[R] files concurrently.
If \f[V]--timestamp\f[R] is used then sets the modification time to that
time instead of the current time.
Times may be specified as one of:
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]YYMMDD\[aq] - e.g.
17.10.30
.IP \[bu] 2
\[aq]YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS\[aq] - e.g.

.SH rclone tree
List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.
.SS Synopsis
Lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the unix tree
command.
For example
$ rclone tree remote:path
/
├── file1
├── file2
├── file3
└── subdir
    ├── file4
    └── file5

1 directories, 5 files
You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (e.g.
\f[V]--include\f[R] and \f[V]--exclude\f[R].
You can also use \f[V]--fast-list\f[R].
The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which are
compatible with the tree command, for example you can include file sizes
with \f[V]--size\f[R].
Note that not all of them have short options as they conflict with
rclone\[aq]s short options.

rclone (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone/) - Show help for rclone
commands, flags and backends.
.SS Copying single files
rclone normally syncs or copies directories.
However, if the source remote points to a file, rclone will just copy
that file.
The destination remote must point to a directory - rclone will give the
error
\f[V]Failed to create file system for \[dq]remote:file\[dq]: is a file not a directory\f[R]
if it isn\[aq]t.
For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
\f[V]test.jpg\f[R], then you could copy just that file like this
rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download
The file \f[V]test.jpg\f[R] will be placed inside
\f[V]/tmp/download\f[R].
.PP
This is equivalent to specifying
rclone copy --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download
Where \f[V]/tmp/files\f[R] contains the single line
test.jpg
.PP
It is recommended to use \f[V]copy\f[R] when copying individual files,
not \f[V]sync\f[R].
They have pretty much the same effect but \f[V]copy\f[R] will use a lot
less memory.
.SS Syntax of remote paths
.PP
The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.
.SS /path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to the local file system.
.PP
On Windows \f[V]\[rs]\f[R] may be used instead of \f[V]/\f[R] in local
paths \f[B]only\f[R], non local paths must use \f[V]/\f[R].
See local filesystem (https://rclone.org/local/#paths-on-windows)
documentation for more about Windows-specific paths.
.PP
These paths needn\[aq]t start with a leading \f[V]/\f[R] - if they
don\[aq]t then they will be relative to the current directory.
.SS remote:path/to/dir
.PP
This refers to a directory \f[V]path/to/dir\f[R] on \f[V]remote:\f[R] as
defined in the config file (configured with \f[V]rclone config\f[R]).
.SS remote:/path/to/dir
.PP
On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
\f[V]remote:path/to/dir\f[R] and that format should be preferred.
On a very small number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this
will refer to a different directory.
On these, paths without a leading \f[V]/\f[R] will refer to your
\[dq]home\[dq] directory and paths with a leading \f[V]/\f[R] will refer
to the root.
.SS :backend:path/to/dir
.PP
This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly.
\f[V]backend\f[R] should be the name or prefix of a backend (the
\f[V]type\f[R] in the config file) and all the configuration for the
backend should be provided on the command line (or in environment
variables).
.PP
Here are some examples:
rclone lsd --http-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:
.PP
To list all the directories in the root of
\f[V]https://pub.rclone.org/\f[R].
rclone lsf --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir
To list files and directories in
\f[V]https://example.com/path/to/dir/\f[R]
rclone copy --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir /tmp/dir
To copy files and directories in
\f[V]https://example.com/path/to/dir\f[R] to \f[V]/tmp/dir\f[R].
rclone copy --sftp-host example.com :sftp:path/to/dir /tmp/dir
To copy files and directories from \f[V]example.com\f[R] in the relative
directory \f[V]path/to/dir\f[R] to \f[V]/tmp/dir\f[R] using sftp.
.SS Connection strings
The above examples can also be written using a connection string syntax,
so instead of providing the arguments as command line parameters
\f[V]--http-url https://pub.rclone.org\f[R] they are provided as part of
the remote specification as a kind of connection string.
rclone lsd \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://pub.rclone.org\[aq]:\[dq]
rclone lsf \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://example.com\[aq]:path/to/dir\[dq]
rclone copy \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://example.com\[aq]:path/to/dir\[dq] /tmp/dir
rclone copy :sftp,host=example.com:path/to/dir /tmp/dir
.PP
These can apply to modify existing remotes as well as create new remotes
with the on the fly syntax.
This example is equivalent to adding the
\f[V]--drive-shared-with-me\f[R] parameter to the remote
\f[V]gdrive:\f[R].
rclone lsf \[dq]gdrive,shared_with_me:path/to/dir\[dq]
The major advantage to using the connection string style syntax is that
it only applies to the remote, not to all the remotes of that type of
the command line.
A common confusion is this attempt to copy a file shared on google drive
to the normal drive which \f[B]does not work\f[R] because the
\f[V]--drive-shared-with-me\f[R] flag applies to both the source and the
destination.
rclone copy --drive-shared-with-me gdrive:shared-file.txt gdrive:
.PP
However using the connection string syntax, this does work.
rclone copy \[dq]gdrive,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt\[dq] gdrive:
Note that the connection string only affects the options of the
immediate backend.
If for example gdriveCrypt is a crypt based on gdrive, then the
following command \f[B]will not work\f[R] as intended, because
\f[V]shared_with_me\f[R] is ignored by the crypt backend:
rclone copy \[dq]gdriveCrypt,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt\[dq] gdriveCrypt:
.PP
The connection strings have the following syntax
remote,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
:backend,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
If the \f[V]parameter\f[R] has a \f[V]:\f[R] or \f[V],\f[R] then it must
be placed in quotes \f[V]\[dq]\f[R] or \f[V]\[aq]\f[R], so
remote,parameter=\[dq]colon:value\[dq],parameter2=\[dq]comma,value\[dq]:path/to/dir
:backend,parameter=\[aq]colon:value\[aq],parameter2=\[aq]comma,value\[aq]:path/to/dir
.PP
If a quoted value needs to include that quote, then it should be
doubled, so
remote,parameter=\[dq]with\[dq]\[dq]quote\[dq],parameter2=\[aq]with\[aq]\[aq]quote\[aq]:path/to/dir
This will make \f[V]parameter\f[R] be \f[V]with\[dq]quote\f[R] and
\f[V]parameter2\f[R] be \f[V]with\[aq]quote\f[R].
If you leave off the \f[V]=parameter\f[R] then rclone will substitute
\f[V]=true\f[R] which works very well with flags.
For example, to use s3 configured in the environment you could use:
rclone lsd :s3,env_auth:
.PP
Which is equivalent to
rclone lsd :s3,env_auth=true:
Note that on the command line you might need to surround these
connection strings with \f[V]\[dq]\f[R] or \f[V]\[aq]\f[R] to stop the
shell interpreting any special characters within them.
If you are a shell master then you\[aq]ll know which strings are OK and
which aren\[aq]t, but if you aren\[aq]t sure then enclose them in
\f[V]\[dq]\f[R] and use \f[V]\[aq]\f[R] as the inside quote.
This syntax works on all OSes.
rclone copy \[dq]:http,url=\[aq]https://example.com\[aq]:path/to/dir\[dq] /tmp/dir
.PP
On Linux/macOS some characters are still interpreted inside
\f[V]\[dq]\f[R] strings in the shell (notably \f[V]\[rs]\f[R] and
\f[V]$\f[R] and \f[V]\[dq]\f[R]) so if your strings contain those you
can swap the roles of \f[V]\[dq]\f[R] and \f[V]\[aq]\f[R] thus.
(This syntax does not work on Windows.)
rclone copy \[aq]:http,url=\[dq]https://example.com\[dq]:path/to/dir\[aq] /tmp/dir
You can use rclone config
string (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_string/) to convert a
remote into a connection string.
.SS Connection strings, config and logging
If you supply extra configuration to a backend by command line flag,
environment variable or connection string then rclone will add a suffix
based on the hash of the config to the name of the remote, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone -vv lsf --s3-chunk-size 20M s3:
\f[R]
.fi
Has the log message
DEBUG : s3: detected overridden config - adding \[dq]{Srj1p}\[dq] suffix to name
This is so rclone can tell the modified remote apart from the unmodified
remote when caching the backends.
This should only be noticeable in the logs.
.PP
This means that on the fly backends such as
rclone -vv lsf :s3,env_auth:
.PP
Will get their own names
DEBUG : :s3: detected overridden config - adding \[dq]{YTu53}\[dq] suffix to name
.SS Valid remote names
Remote names are case sensitive, and must adhere to the following rules:
May contain number, letter, \f[V]_\f[R], \f[V]-\f[R], \f[V].\f[R],
\f[V]+\f[R], \f[V]\[at]\f[R] and space.
.IP \[bu] 2
May not start with \f[V]-\f[R] or space.
.IP \[bu] 2
May not end with space.
Starting with rclone version 1.61, any Unicode numbers and letters are
allowed, while in older versions it was limited to plain ASCII (0-9,
A-Z, a-z).
If you use the same rclone configuration from different shells, which
may be configured with different character encoding, you must be
cautious to use characters that are possible to write in all of them.
This is mostly a problem on Windows, where the console traditionally
uses a non-Unicode character set - defined by the so-called \[dq]code
page\[dq].
Do not use single character names on Windows as it creates ambiguity
with Windows drives\[aq] names, e.g.: remote called \f[V]C\f[R] is
indistinguishable from \f[V]C\f[R] drive.
Rclone will always assume that single letter name refers to a drive.
.SS Adding global configuration to a remote
It is possible to add global configuration to the remote configuration
which will be applied just before the remote is created.
This can be done in two ways.
The first is to use \f[V]override.var = value\f[R] in the config file or
the connection string for a temporary change, and the second is to use
\f[V]global.var = value\f[R] in the config file or connection string for
a permanent change.
This is explained fully below.
.SS override.var
This is used to override a global variable \f[B]just\f[R] for the
duration of the remote creation.
It won\[aq]t affect other remotes even if they are created at the same
time.
.PP
This is very useful for overriding networking config needed for just for
that remote.
For example, say you have a remote which needs
\f[V]--no-check-certificate\f[R] as it is running on test infrastructure
without a proper certificate.
You could supply the \f[V]--no-check-certificate\f[R] flag to rclone,
but this will affect \f[B]all\f[R] the remotes.
To make it just affect this remote you use an override.
You could put this in the config file:
[remote]
type = XXX
\&...
override.no_check_certificate = true
.PP
or use it in the connection string
\f[V]remote,override.no_check_certificate=true:\f[R] (or just
\f[V]remote,override.no_check_certificate:\f[R]).
.PP
Note how the global flag name loses its initial \f[V]--\f[R] and gets
\f[V]-\f[R] replaced with \f[V]_\f[R] and gets an \f[V]override.\f[R]
prefix.
.PP
Not all global variables make sense to be overridden like this as the
config is only applied during the remote creation.
Here is a non exhaustive list of ones which might be useful:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]bind_addr\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]ca_cert\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]client_cert\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]client_key\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]connect_timeout\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]disable_http2\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]disable_http_keep_alives\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]dump\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]expect_continue_timeout\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]headers\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]http_proxy\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]low_level_retries\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]max_connections\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]no_check_certificate\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]no_gzip\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]timeout\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]traffic_class\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]use_cookies\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]use_server_modtime\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]user_agent\f[R]
.PP
An \f[V]override.var\f[R] will override all other config methods, but
\f[B]just\f[R] for the duration of the creation of the remote.
.SS global.var
.PP
This is used to set a global variable \f[B]for everything\f[R].
The global variable is set just before the remote is created.
.PP
This is useful for parameters (eg sync parameters) which can\[aq]t be
set as an \f[V]override\f[R].
For example, say you have a remote where you would always like to use
the \f[V]--checksum\f[R] flag.
You could supply the \f[V]--checksum\f[R] flag to rclone on every
command line, but instead you could put this in the config file:
[remote]
type = XXX
\&...
global.checksum = true
or use it in the connection string
\f[V]remote,global.checksum=true:\f[R] (or just
\f[V]remote,global.checksum:\f[R]).
This is equivalent to using the \f[V]--checksum\f[R] flag.
Note how the global flag name loses its initial \f[V]--\f[R] and gets
\f[V]-\f[R] replaced with \f[V]_\f[R] and gets a \f[V]global.\f[R]
prefix.
.PP
Any global variable can be set like this and it is exactly equivalent to
using the equivalent flag on the command line.
This means it will affect all uses of rclone.
.PP
If two remotes set the same global variable then the first one
instantiated will be overridden by the second one.
A \f[V]global.var\f[R] will override all other config methods when the
remote is created.
.SS Quoting and the shell
.PP
When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.
This interprets various characters in an OS specific way.
.PP
Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules
.SS Linux / macOS
.PP
If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (e.g.
\f[V]*\f[R], \f[V]?\f[R], \f[V]$\f[R], \f[V]\[aq]\f[R], \f[V]\[dq]\f[R],
etc.)
then you must quote them.
Use single quotes \f[V]\[aq]\f[R] by default.
rclone copy \[aq]Important files?\[aq] remote:backup
If you want to send a \f[V]\[aq]\f[R] you will need to use
\f[V]\[dq]\f[R], e.g.
rclone copy \[dq]O\[aq]Reilly Reviews\[dq] remote:backup
The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you\[aq]ll have to consult the manual page for your shell.
.SS Windows
.PP
If your names have spaces in you need to put them in \f[V]\[dq]\f[R],
e.g.
rclone copy \[dq]E:\[rs]folder name\[rs]folder name\[rs]folder name\[dq] remote:backup
If you are using the root directory on its own then don\[aq]t quote it
(see #464 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/464) for why), e.g.
rclone copy E:\[rs] remote:backup
.SS Copying files or directories with \f[V]:\f[R] in the names
rclone uses \f[V]:\f[R] to mark a remote name.
This is, however, a valid filename component in non-Windows OSes.
The remote name parser will only search for a \f[V]:\f[R] up to the
first \f[V]/\f[R] so if you need to act on a file or directory like this
then use the full path starting with a \f[V]/\f[R], or use \f[V]./\f[R]
as a current directory prefix.
So to sync a directory called \f[V]sync:me\f[R] to a remote called
\f[V]remote:\f[R] use
rclone sync --interactive ./sync:me remote:path
.PP
or
rclone sync --interactive /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path
.SS Server-side copy
Most remotes (but not all - see the
overview (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)) support
server-side copy.
This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone
won\[aq]t download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct
the server to copy them in place.
.PP
Eg
rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket
Will copy the contents of \f[V]oldbucket\f[R] to \f[V]newbucket\f[R]
without downloading and re-uploading.
.PP
Remotes which don\[aq]t support server-side copy \f[B]will\f[R] download
and re-upload in this case.
.PP
Server-side copies are used with \f[V]sync\f[R] and \f[V]copy\f[R] and
will be identified in the log when using the \f[V]-v\f[R] flag.
The \f[V]move\f[R] command may also use them if remote doesn\[aq]t
support server-side move directly.
This is done by issuing a server-side copy then a delete which is much
quicker than a download and re-upload.
.PP
Server-side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.
.PP
This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, e.g.
rclone sync --interactive remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
rclone sync --interactive /path/to/files remote:current-backup
.SS Metadata support
.PP
Metadata is data about a file (or directory) which isn\[aq]t the
contents of the file (or directory).
Normally rclone only preserves the modification time and the content
(MIME) type where possible.
.PP
Rclone supports preserving all the available metadata on files and
directories when using the \f[V]--metadata\f[R] or \f[V]-M\f[R] flag.
.PP
Exactly what metadata is supported and what that support means depends
on the backend.
Backends that support metadata have a metadata section in their docs and
are listed in the features table (https://rclone.org/overview/#features)
(Eg local (https://rclone.org/local/#metadata), s3)
.PP
Some backends don\[aq]t support metadata, some only support metadata on
files and some support metadata on both files and directories.
.PP
Rclone only supports a one-time sync of metadata.
This means that metadata will be synced from the source object to the
destination object only when the source object has changed and needs to
be re-uploaded.
If the metadata subsequently changes on the source object without
changing the object itself then it won\[aq]t be synced to the
destination object.
This is in line with the way rclone syncs \f[V]Content-Type\f[R] without
the \f[V]--metadata\f[R] flag.
.PP
Using \f[V]--metadata\f[R] when syncing from local to local will
preserve file attributes such as file mode, owner, extended attributes
(not Windows).
.PP
Note that arbitrary metadata may be added to objects using the
\f[V]--metadata-set key=value\f[R] flag when the object is first
uploaded.
This flag can be repeated as many times as necessary.
.PP
The --metadata-mapper flag can be used to pass the name of a program in
which can transform metadata when it is being copied from source to
destination.
.PP
Rclone supports \f[V]--metadata-set\f[R] and \f[V]--metadata-mapper\f[R]
when doing server-side \f[V]Move\f[R] and server-side \f[V]Copy\f[R],
but not when doing server side \f[V]DirMove\f[R] (renaming a directory)
as this would involve recursing into the directory.
Note that you can disable \f[V]DirMove\f[R] with
\f[V]--disable DirMove\f[R] and rclone will revert back to using
\f[V]Move\f[R] for each individual object where \f[V]--metadata-set\f[R]
and \f[V]--metadata-mapper\f[R] are supported.
.SS Types of metadata
.PP
Metadata is divided into two type.
System metadata and User metadata.
.PP
Metadata which the backend uses itself is called system metadata.
For example on the local backend the system metadata \f[V]uid\f[R] will
store the user ID of the file when used on a unix based platform.
.PP
Arbitrary metadata is called user metadata and this can be set however
is desired.
.PP
When objects are copied from backend to backend, they will attempt to
interpret system metadata if it is supplied.
Metadata may change from being user metadata to system metadata as
objects are copied between different backends.
For example copying an object from s3 sets the \f[V]content-type\f[R]
metadata.
In a backend which understands this (like \f[V]azureblob\f[R]) this will
become the Content-Type of the object.
In a backend which doesn\[aq]t understand this (like the \f[V]local\f[R]
backend) this will become user metadata.
However should the local object be copied back to s3, the Content-Type
will be set correctly.
.SS Metadata framework
.PP
Rclone implements a metadata framework which can read metadata from an
object and write it to the object when (and only when) it is being
uploaded.
.PP
This metadata is stored as a dictionary with string keys and string
values.
.PP
There are some limits on the names of the keys (these may be clarified
further in the future).
must be lower case
.IP \[bu] 2
may be \f[V]a-z\f[R] \f[V]0-9\f[R] containing \f[V].\f[R] \f[V]-\f[R] or
\f[V]_\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
length is backend dependent
Each backend can provide system metadata that it understands.
Some backends can also store arbitrary user metadata.
Where possible the key names are standardized, so, for example, it is
possible to copy object metadata from s3 to azureblob for example and
metadata will be translated appropriately.
Some backends have limits on the size of the metadata and rclone will
give errors on upload if they are exceeded.
.SS Metadata preservation
The goal of the implementation is to
.IP "1." 3
Preserve metadata if at all possible
.IP "2." 3
Interpret metadata if at all possible
The consequences of 1 is that you can copy an S3 object to a local disk
then back to S3 losslessly.
Likewise you can copy a local file with file attributes and xattrs from
local disk to s3 and back again losslessly.
The consequence of 2 is that you can copy an S3 object with metadata to
Azureblob (say) and have the metadata appear on the Azureblob object
also.
.SS Standard system metadata
Here is a table of standard system metadata which, if appropriate, a
backend may implement.

.TE
The metadata keys \f[V]mtime\f[R] and \f[V]content-type\f[R] will take
precedence if supplied in the metadata over reading the
\f[V]Content-Type\f[R] or modification time of the source object.
Hashes are not included in system metadata as there is a well defined
way of reading those already.
.SS Options
Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.
These are documented below, and in the flags page.
Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
\f[V]--option=value\f[R] or \f[V]--option value\f[R].
However boolean (true/false) options behave slightly differently to the
other options in that \f[V]--boolean\f[R] sets the option to
\f[V]true\f[R] and the absence of the flag sets it to \f[V]false\f[R].
It is also possible to specify \f[V]--boolean=false\f[R] or
\f[V]--boolean=true\f[R].
Note that \f[V]--boolean false\f[R] is not valid - this is parsed as
\f[V]--boolean\f[R] and the \f[V]false\f[R] is parsed as an extra
command line argument for rclone.
String values that are recognized as special identifiers, e.g.
the name of the log level to set with option \f[V]--log-level\f[R], are
case insensitive, e.g.
\f[V]--log-level ERROR\f[R] and \f[V]--log-level error\f[R] are
identical.
Options documented to take a \f[V]stringArray\f[R] parameter accept
multiple values.
To pass more than one value, repeat the option; for example:
\f[V]--include value1 --include value2\f[R].
Other options may only accept a single value, and should only be
specified once, but where the specified parameter may indicate a list of
values separated by space or comma.
Such options are documented to take a \f[V]CommaSepList\f[R] parameter,
if comma separated, and \f[V]SpaceSepList\f[R] if space separated,
although some may also have different parameters such as
\f[V]DumpFlags\f[R] or just \f[V]string\f[R] and the help text explains
that this will be interpreted as a list.
.PP
Floating-point values with fractional part must use period (\f[V].\f[R])
as decimal separator, common in English-speaking countries, regardless
of your configured system locale.
Parameter type \f[V]float\f[R] accepts decimal and hexadecimal
floating-point numbers as defined by the Go syntax for floating-point
literals (https://go.dev/ref/spec#Floating-point_literals).
.SS Time and duration options
.PP
Options that take a \f[V]Time\f[R] or \f[V]Duration\f[R] parameter must
be specified as a formatted string describing an absolute or relative
time.
Note that both \f[V]Time\f[R] and \f[V]Duration\f[R] parameter types can
be expressed as either absolute or relative time, just with different
interpretations, e.g.
a relative time will be treated as an offset from the current time when
passed as a \f[V]Time\f[R] value.
.PP
An absolute time can be specified as a string in one of the following
formats:
.IP \[bu] 2
RFC3339 - e.g.
\f[V]2006-01-02T15:04:05Z\f[R] or \f[V]2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - \f[V]2006-01-02T15:04:05\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - \f[V]2006-01-02 15:04:05\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
ISO8601 Date - \f[V]2006-01-02\f[R] (YYYY-MM-DD)
.PP
A relative time is a string with a, possibly signed, sequence of decimal
numbers, each with optional fraction, and each with a unit suffix.
If the string only contains a single number, then the unit suffix is
optional and will default to seconds, i.e.
a plain decimal value will be treated as a number of seconds.
The following suffixes are valid:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]ms\f[R] - Milliseconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]s\f[R] - Seconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]m\f[R] - Minutes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]h\f[R] - Hours
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]d\f[R] - Days
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]w\f[R] - Weeks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]M\f[R] - Months
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]y\f[R] - Years
.PP
Examples: \[dq]10\[dq], \[dq]300ms\[dq], \[dq]-1.5h\[dq] or
\[dq]2h45m\[dq].
.SS Size options
.PP
Options that take a SizeSuffix parameter can be specified as an integer
value, which will then be assumed to represent a KiB value (multiples of
1024 bytes) by default.
The interpretation can be changed by appending a suffix: \f[V]B\f[R] for
Byte, \f[V]K\f[R] for KiB, \f[V]M\f[R] for MiB, \f[V]G\f[R] for GiB,
\f[V]T\f[R] for TiB and \f[V]P\f[R] for PiB.
These are the binary units, e.g.
1, 2**10, 2**20, 2**30 respectively.
.PP
See also --human-readable.
.SS Main options
.SS --backup-dir string
.PP
When using sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) or
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/), any files which would
have been overwritten or deleted are moved in their original hierarchy
into this directory.
.PP
If \f[V]--suffix\f[R] is set, then the moved files will have the suffix
added to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added)
in the directory, then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The backup directory must not overlap the destination directory without
it being excluded by a filter rule.
.PP
For example
rclone sync --interactive /path/to/local remote:current --backup-dir remote:old
will sync \f[V]/path/to/local\f[R] to \f[V]remote:current\f[R], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in
\f[V]remote:old\f[R].
.PP
If running rclone from a script you might want to use today\[aq]s date
as the directory name passed to \f[V]--backup-dir\f[R] to store the old
files, or you might want to pass \f[V]--suffix\f[R] with today\[aq]s
date.
This can be done with \f[V]--suffix $(date +%F)\f[R] in bash, and
\f[V]--suffix $(Get-Date -Format \[aq]yyyy-MM-dd\[aq])\f[R] in
PowerShell.
.PP
See \f[V]--compare-dest\f[R] and \f[V]--copy-dest\f[R].
.SS --bind string
.PP
Local address to bind to for outgoing connections.
This can be an IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or
host name.
If the host name doesn\[aq]t resolve or resolves to more than one IP
address it will give an error.
.PP
You can use \f[V]--bind 0.0.0.0\f[R] to force rclone to use IPv4
addresses and \f[V]--bind ::0\f[R] to force rclone to use IPv6
addresses.
.SS --bwlimit BwTimetable
.PP
This option controls the bandwidth limit.
For example
--bwlimit 10M
would mean limit the upload and download bandwidth to 10 MiB/s.
\f[B]NB\f[R] this is \f[B]bytes\f[R] per second not \f[B]bits\f[R] per
second.
To use a single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in KiB/s, or use a
suffix B|K|M|G|T|P.
The default is \f[V]0\f[R] which means to not limit bandwidth.
.PP
The upload and download bandwidth can be specified separately, as
\f[V]--bwlimit UP:DOWN\f[R], so
--bwlimit 10M:100k
would mean limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s and the download
bandwidth to 100 KiB/s.
Either limit can be \[dq]off\[dq] meaning no limit, so to just limit the
upload bandwidth you would use
--bwlimit 10M:off
this would limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s but the download
bandwidth would be unlimited.
When specified as above the bandwidth limits last for the duration of
run of the rclone binary.
It is also possible to specify a \[dq]timetable\[dq] of limits, which
will cause certain limits to be applied at certain times.
To specify a timetable, format your entries as
\f[V]WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH...\f[R] where:
\f[V]WEEKDAY\f[R] is optional element.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]BANDWIDTH\f[R] can be a single number, e.g.\f[V]100k\f[R] or a pair
of numbers for upload:download, e.g.\f[V]10M:1M\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]WEEKDAY\f[R] can be written as the whole word or only using the
first 3 characters.
It is optional.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]HH:MM\f[R] is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.
Entries can be separated by spaces or semicolons.
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Semicolons can be used as separators instead of spaces
to avoid parsing issues in containerized environments.
An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during
daytime working hours could be:
Using spaces as separators:
\f[V]--bwlimit \[dq]08:00,512k 12:00,10M 13:00,512k 18:00,30M 23:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
Using semicolons as separators:
\f[V]--bwlimit \[dq]08:00,512k;12:00,10M;13:00,512k;18:00,30M;23:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
In these examples, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s at
8am every day.
At noon, it will rise to 10 MiB/s, and drop back to 512 KiB/sec at 1pm.
At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to 30 MiB/s, and at 11pm it will
be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.
An example of timetable with \f[V]WEEKDAY\f[R] could be:
Using spaces as separators:
\f[V]--bwlimit \[dq]Mon-00:00,512 Fri-23:59,10M Sat-10:00,1M Sun-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
Using semicolons as separators:
\f[V]--bwlimit \[dq]Mon-00:00,512;Fri-23:59,10M;Sat-10:00,1M;Sun-20:00,off\[dq]\f[R]
It means that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s on
Monday.
It will rise to 10 MiB/s before the end of Friday.
At 10:00 on Saturday it will be set to 1 MiB/s.
From 20:00 on Sunday it will be unlimited.
Timeslots without \f[V]WEEKDAY\f[R] are extended to the whole week.
So this example:
--bwlimit \[dq]Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off\[dq]
Is equivalent to this:
--bwlimit \[dq]Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off\[dq]
Bandwidth limit apply to the data transfer for all backends.
For most backends the directory listing bandwidth is also included
(exceptions being the non HTTP backends, \f[V]ftp\f[R], \f[V]sftp\f[R]
and \f[V]storj\f[R]).
Note that the units are \f[B]Byte/s\f[R], not \f[B]bit/s\f[R].
Typically connections are measured in bit/s - to convert divide by 8.
For example, let\[aq]s say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish
rclone to use half of it - 5 Mbit/s.
This is 5/8 = 0.625 MiB/s so you would use a \f[V]--bwlimit 0.625M\f[R]
parameter for rclone.
On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, \&...)
the bandwidth limiter can be toggled by sending a \f[V]SIGUSR2\f[R]
signal to rclone.
This allows to remove the limitations of a long running rclone transfer
and to restore it back to the value specified with \f[V]--bwlimit\f[R]
quickly when needed.
Assuming there is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the
limiter like this:
kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)
If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use change
the bwlimit dynamically:
rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M
.SS --bwlimit-file BwTimetable
This option controls per file bandwidth limit.
For the options see the \f[V]--bwlimit\f[R] flag.
.PP
For example use this to allow no transfers to be faster than 1 MiB/s
--bwlimit-file 1M
This can be used in conjunction with \f[V]--bwlimit\f[R].
Note that if a schedule is provided the file will use the schedule in
effect at the start of the transfer.
.SS --buffer-size SizeSuffix
Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers.
Each \f[V]--transfer\f[R] will use this much memory for buffering.
When using \f[V]mount\f[R] or \f[V]cmount\f[R] each open file descriptor
will use this much memory for buffering.
See the mount (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#file-buffering)
documentation for more details.
Set to \f[V]0\f[R] to disable the buffering for the minimum memory
usage.
Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
--use-mmap flag.
.SS --cache-dir string
Specify the directory rclone will use for caching, to override the
default.
Default value is depending on operating system:
Windows \f[V]%LocalAppData%\[rs]rclone\f[R], if \f[V]LocalAppData\f[R]
is defined.
macOS \f[V]$HOME/Library/Caches/rclone\f[R] if \f[V]HOME\f[R] is
defined.
Unix \f[V]$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rclone\f[R] if \f[V]XDG_CACHE_HOME\f[R] is
defined, else \f[V]$HOME/.cache/rclone\f[R] if \f[V]HOME\f[R] is
defined.
Fallback (on all OS) to \f[V]$TMPDIR/rclone\f[R], where \f[V]TMPDIR\f[R]
is the value from --temp-dir.
You can use the config
paths (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/) command to see
the current value.
Cache directory is heavily used by the VFS File
Caching (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-file-caching)
mount feature, but also by
serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/), GUI and other parts
of rclone.
.SS --check-first
If this flag is set then in a
sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) or
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/), rclone will do all the
checks to see whether files need to be transferred before doing any of
the transfers.
Normally rclone would start running transfers as soon as possible.
This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers interfere
with checking.
It can also be useful to ensure perfect ordering when using
\f[V]--order-by\f[R].
If both \f[V]--check-first\f[R] and \f[V]--order-by\f[R] are set when
doing \f[V]rclone move\f[R] then rclone will use the transfer thread to
delete source files which don\[aq]t need transferring.
This will enable perfect ordering of the transfers and deletes but will
cause the transfer stats to have more items in than expected.
Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets
\f[V]--max-backlog\f[R] to infinite.
This means that all the info on the objects to transfer is held in
memory before the transfers start.
.SS --checkers int
Originally controlling just the number of file checkers to run in
parallel, e.g.
by \f[V]rclone copy\f[R].
Now a fairly universal parallelism control used by \f[V]rclone\f[R] in
several places.
Note: checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync.
For some storage systems (e.g.
S3, Swift, Dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they
are run in parallel.
The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.
However, in case of slow-reacting backends you may need to lower (rather
than increase) this default by setting \f[V]--checkers\f[R] to 4 or less
threads.
This is especially advised if you are experiencing backend server
crashes during file checking phase (e.g.
on subsequent or top-up backups where little or no file copying is done
and checking takes up most of the time).
Increase this setting only with utmost care, while monitoring your
server health and file checking throughput.
.SS -c, --checksum
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check the file hash and size to
determine if files are equal.
This is useful when the remote doesn\[aq]t support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.
This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, e.g.
Drive and Swift.
For details of which remotes support which hash type see the table in
the overview section (https://rclone.org/overview/).
Eg \f[V]rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket\f[R] would run
much quicker than without the \f[V]--checksum\f[R] flag.
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS --color AUTO|NEVER|ALWAYS
Specify when colors (and other ANSI codes) should be added to the
output.
\f[V]AUTO\f[R] only allows ANSI codes when the output is a terminal.
This is the default.
\f[V]NEVER\f[R] never allow ANSI codes.
\f[V]ALWAYS\f[R] always add ANSI codes, regardless of the output format
(terminal or file).
.SS --compare-dest stringArray
When using sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) or
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/), the specified paths are
checked in addition to the destination for files.
If a file identical to the source is found, that file is \f[B]not\f[R]
copied from source.
This is useful to copy just files that have changed since the last
backup.
.PP
You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[V]--copy-dest\f[R] and \f[V]--backup-dir\f[R].
.SS --config string
.PP
Specify the location of the rclone configuration file, to override the
default.
E.g.
\f[V]rclone config --config=\[dq]rclone.conf\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
The exact default is a bit complex to describe, due to changes
introduced through different versions of rclone while preserving
backwards compatibility, but in most cases it is as simple as:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] on Windows
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]\[ti]/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] on other
.PP
The complete logic is as follows: Rclone will look for an existing
configuration file in any of the following locations, in priority order:
.IP "1." 3
\f[V]rclone.conf\f[R] (in program directory, where rclone executable is)
.IP "2." 3
\f[V]%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] (only on Windows)
.IP "3." 3
\f[V]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] (on all systems, including
Windows)
.IP "4." 3
\f[V]\[ti]/.config/rclone/rclone.conf\f[R] (see below for explanation of
\[ti] symbol)
.IP "5." 3
\f[V]\[ti]/.rclone.conf\f[R]
.PP
If no existing configuration file is found, then a new one will be
created in the following location:
.IP \[bu] 2
On Windows: Location 2 listed above, except in the unlikely event that
\f[V]APPDATA\f[R] is not defined, then location 4 is used instead.
.IP \[bu] 2
On Unix: Location 3 if \f[V]XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R] is defined, else
location 4.
.IP \[bu] 2
Fallback to location 5 (on all OS), when the rclone directory cannot be
created, but if also a home directory was not found then path
\f[V].rclone.conf\f[R] relative to current working directory will be
used as a final resort.
.PP
The \f[V]\[ti]\f[R] symbol in paths above represent the home directory
of the current user on any OS, and the value is defined as following:
.IP \[bu] 2
On Windows: \f[V]%HOME%\f[R] if defined, else \f[V]%USERPROFILE%\f[R],
or else \f[V]%HOMEDRIVE%\[rs]%HOMEPATH%\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
On Unix: \f[V]$HOME\f[R] if defined, else by looking up current user in
OS-specific user database (e.g.
passwd file), or else use the result from shell command
\f[V]cd && pwd\f[R].
.PP
If you run \f[V]rclone config file\f[R] you will see where the default
location is for you.
Running \f[V]rclone config touch\f[R] will ensure a configuration file
exists, creating an empty one in the default location if there is none.
.PP
The fact that an existing file \f[V]rclone.conf\f[R] in the same
directory as the rclone executable is always preferred, means that it is
easy to run in \[dq]portable\[dq] mode by downloading rclone executable
to a writable directory and then create an empty file
\f[V]rclone.conf\f[R] in the same directory.
.PP
If the location is set to empty string \f[V]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R] or path to a
file with name \f[V]notfound\f[R], or the os null device represented by
value \f[V]NUL\f[R] on Windows and \f[V]/dev/null\f[R] on Unix systems,
then rclone will keep the configuration file in memory only.
.PP
You may see a log message \[dq]Config file not found - using
defaults\[dq] if there is no configuration file.
This can be supressed, e.g.
if you are using rclone entirely with on the fly
remotes (https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir), by using
memory-only configuration file or by creating an empty configuration
file, as described above.
.PP
The file format is basic
INI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Format): Sections of text,
led by a \f[V][section]\f[R] header and followed by \f[V]key=value\f[R]
entries on separate lines.
In rclone each remote is represented by its own section, where the
section name defines the name of the remote.
Options are specified as the \f[V]key=value\f[R] entries, where the key
is the option name without the \f[V]--backend-\f[R] prefix, in lowercase
and with \f[V]_\f[R] instead of \f[V]-\f[R].
E.g.
option \f[V]--mega-hard-delete\f[R] corresponds to key
\f[V]hard_delete\f[R].
Only backend options can be specified.
A special, and required, key \f[V]type\f[R] identifies the storage
system (https://rclone.org/overview/), where the value is the internal
lowercase name as returned by command \f[V]rclone help backends\f[R].
Comments are indicated by \f[V];\f[R] or \f[V]#\f[R] at the beginning of
a line.
.PP
Example:
[megaremote]
type = mega
user = you\[at]example.com
pass = PDPcQVVjVtzFY-GTdDFozqBhTdsPg3qH
Note that passwords are in
obscured (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/) form.
Also, many storage systems uses token-based authentication instead of
passwords, and this requires additional steps.
It is easier, and safer, to use the interactive command
\f[V]rclone config\f[R] instead of manually editing the configuration
file.
The configuration file will typically contain login information, and
should therefore have restricted permissions so that only the current
user can read it.
Rclone tries to ensure this when it writes the file.
You may also choose to encrypt the file.
When token-based authentication are used, the configuration file must be
writable, because rclone needs to update the tokens inside it.
To reduce risk of corrupting an existing configuration file, rclone will
not write directly to it when saving changes.
Instead it will first write to a new, temporary, file.
If a configuration file already existed, it will (on Unix systems) try
to mirror its permissions to the new file.
Then it will rename the existing file to a temporary name as backup.
Next, rclone will rename the new file to the correct name, before
finally cleaning up by deleting the backup file.
If the configuration file path used by rclone is a symbolic link, then
this will be evaluated and rclone will write to the resolved path,
instead of overwriting the symbolic link.
Temporary files used in the process (described above) will be written to
the same parent directory as that of the resolved configuration file,
but if this directory is also a symbolic link it will not be resolved
and the temporary files will be written to the location of the directory
symbolic link.
.SS --contimeout Duration
.PP
Set the connection timeout.
This should be in go time format which looks like \f[V]5s\f[R] for 5
seconds, \f[V]10m\f[R] for 10 minutes, or \f[V]3h30m\f[R].
.PP
The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.
It is \f[V]1m\f[R] by default.
.SS --copy-dest stringArray
.PP
When using sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) or
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/), the specified paths are
checked in addition to the destination for files.
This part is the same as \f[V]--compare-dest\f[R], but the difference is
that with \f[V]--copy-dest\f[R], if a file identical to the source is
found, that file is server-side copied from the specified paths to the
destination.
This is useful for incremental backup.
.PP
The remote in use must support server-side copy and you must use the
same remote as the destination of the sync.
The compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.
.PP
See \f[V]--compare-dest\f[R] and \f[V]--backup-dir\f[R].
.SS --dedupe-mode interactive|skip|first|newest|oldest|largest|smallest|rename|list
.PP
Mode to run dedupe command in.
One of \f[V]interactive\f[R], \f[V]skip\f[R], \f[V]first\f[R],
\f[V]newest\f[R], \f[V]oldest\f[R], \f[V]largest\f[R],
\f[V]smallest\f[R], \f[V]rename\f[R] \f[V]list\f[R].
The default is \f[V]interactive\f[R].
See the dedupe (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_dedupe/) command for
more information as to what these options mean.
.SS --default-time Time
.PP
If a file or directory does have a modification time rclone can read
then rclone will display this fixed time instead.
.PP
The default is \f[V]2000-01-01 00:00:00 UTC\f[R].
This can be configured in any of the ways shown in time options.
.PP
For example \f[V]--default-time 2020-06-01\f[R] to set the default time
to the 1st of June 2020 or \f[V]--default-time 0s\f[R] to set the
default time to the time rclone started up.
.SS --disable string
.PP
This disables a comma separated list of optional features.
For example to disable server-side move and server-side copy use:
--disable move,copy
The features can be put in any case.
To see a list of which features can be disabled use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
--disable help
\f[R]
.fi
The features a remote has can be seen in JSON format with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone backend features remote:
\f[R]
.fi
See the overview features (https://rclone.org/overview/#features) and
optional features (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) to
get an idea of which feature does what.
Note that some features can be set to \f[V]true\f[R] if they are
\f[V]true\f[R]/\f[V]false\f[R] feature flag features by prefixing them
with \f[V]!\f[R].
For example the \f[V]CaseInsensitive\f[R] feature can be forced to
\f[V]false\f[R] with \f[V]--disable CaseInsensitive\f[R] and forced to
\f[V]true\f[R] with \f[V]--disable \[aq]!CaseInsensitive\[aq]\f[R].
In general it isn\[aq]t a good idea doing this but it may be useful in
extremis.
(Note that \f[V]!\f[R] is a shell command which you will need to escape
with single quotes or a backslash on unix like platforms.)
This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(e.g.
Google Drive limiting the total volume of server-side copies to 100
GiB/day).
.SS --disable-http2
This stops rclone from trying to use HTTP/2 if available.
This can sometimes speed up transfers due to a problem in the Go
standard library (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37373).
.SS --dscp string
Specify a DSCP value or name to use in connections.
This could help QoS system to identify traffic class.
BE, EF, DF, LE, CSx and AFxx are allowed.
See the description of differentiated
services (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services) to get
an idea of this field.
Setting this to 1 (LE) to identify the flow to SCAVENGER class can avoid
occupying too much bandwidth in a network with DiffServ support (RFC
8622 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8622)).
For example, if you configured QoS on router to handle LE properly.
Running:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone copy --dscp LE from:/from to:/to
\f[R]
.fi
would make the priority lower than usual internet flows.
This option has no effect on Windows (see
golang/go#42728 (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42728)).
.SS -n, --dry-run
Do a trial run with no permanent changes.
Use this to see what rclone would do without actually doing it.
Useful when setting up the
sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) command which deletes
files in the destination.
.SS --expect-continue-timeout Duration
This specifies the amount of time to wait for a server\[aq]s first
response headers after fully writing the request headers if the request
has an \[dq]Expect: 100-continue\[dq] header.
Not all backends support using this.
Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately,
without waiting for the server to approve.
This time does not include the time to send the request header.
.PP
The default is \f[V]1s\f[R].
Set to \f[V]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS --error-on-no-transfer
.PP
By default, rclone will exit with return code 0 if there were no errors.
.PP
This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were
transferred between the source and destination.
This allows using rclone in scripts, and triggering follow-on actions if
data was copied, or skipping if not.
.PP
NB: Enabling this option turns a usually non-fatal error into a
potentially fatal one - please check and adjust your scripts
accordingly!
.SS --fix-case
.PP
Normally, a sync to a case insensitive dest (such as macOS / Windows)
will not result in a matching filename if the source and dest filenames
have casing differences but are otherwise identical.
For example, syncing \f[V]hello.txt\f[R] to \f[V]HELLO.txt\f[R] will
normally result in the dest filename remaining \f[V]HELLO.txt\f[R].
If \f[V]--fix-case\f[R] is set, then \f[V]HELLO.txt\f[R] will be renamed
to \f[V]hello.txt\f[R] to match the source.
.PP
NB:
directory names with incorrect casing will also be fixed
\f[V]--fix-case\f[R] will be ignored if \f[V]--immutable\f[R] is set
using \f[V]--local-case-sensitive\f[R] instead is not advisable; it will
cause \f[V]HELLO.txt\f[R] to get deleted!
.IP \[bu] 2
the old dest filename must not be excluded by filters.
Be especially careful with
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] (https://rclone.org/filtering/#files-from-read-list-of-source-file-names),
which does not respect
\f[V]--ignore-case\f[R] (https://rclone.org/filtering/#ignore-case-make-searches-case-insensitive)!
.IP \[bu] 2
on remotes that do not support server-side move, \f[V]--fix-case\f[R]
will require downloading the file and re-uploading it.
To avoid this, do not use \f[V]--fix-case\f[R].
.SS --fs-cache-expire-duration Duration
When using rclone via the API rclone caches created remotes for 5
minutes by default in the \[dq]fs cache\[dq].
This means that if you do repeated actions on the same remote then
rclone won\[aq]t have to build it again from scratch, which makes it
more efficient.
This flag sets the time that the remotes are cached for.
If you set it to \f[V]0\f[R] (or negative) then rclone won\[aq]t cache
the remotes at all.
Note that if you use some flags, eg \f[V]--backup-dir\f[R] and if this
is set to \f[V]0\f[R] rclone may build two remotes (one for the source
or destination and one for the \f[V]--backup-dir\f[R] where it may have
only built one before.
.SS --fs-cache-expire-interval Duration
This controls how often rclone checks for cached remotes to expire.
See the \f[V]--fs-cache-expire-duration\f[R] documentation above for
more info.
The default is 60s, set to 0 to disable expiry.
.SS --header stringArray
Add an HTTP header for all transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
If you want to add headers only for uploads use
\f[V]--header-upload\f[R] and if you want to add headers only for
downloads use \f[V]--header-download\f[R].
This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not
supported by \f[V]--header-upload\f[R] and \f[V]--header-download\f[R]
so may be used as a workaround for those with care.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone ls remote:test --header \[dq]X-Rclone: Foo\[dq] --header \[dq]X-LetMeIn: Yes\[dq]
\f[R]

.SS --header-download stringArray
Add an HTTP header for all download transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync --interactive s3:test/src \[ti]/dst --header-download \[dq]X-Amz-Meta-Test: Foo\[dq] --header-download \[dq]X-Amz-Meta-Test2: Bar\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
See GitHub issue #59 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59) for
currently supported backends.
.SS --header-upload stringArray
Add an HTTP header for all upload transactions.
The flag can be repeated to add multiple headers.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync --interactive \[ti]/src s3:test/dst --header-upload \[dq]Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\[aq]cool.html\[aq]\[dq] --header-upload \[dq]X-Amz-Meta-Test: FooBar\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
See GitHub issue #59 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59) for
currently supported backends.
.SS --http-proxy string
Use this option to set an HTTP proxy for all HTTP based services to use.
Rclone also supports the standard HTTP proxy environment variables which
it will pick up automatically.
The is the way the HTTP proxy will normally be set but this flag can be
used to override it.
.SS --human-readable
Rclone commands output values for sizes (e.g.
number of bytes) and counts (e.g.
number of files) either as \f[I]raw\f[R] numbers, or in
\f[I]human-readable\f[R] format.
In human-readable format the values are scaled to larger units,
indicated with a suffix shown after the value, and rounded to three
decimals.
Rclone consistently uses binary units (powers of 2) for sizes and
decimal units (powers of 10) for counts.
The unit prefix for size is according to IEC standard notation, e.g.
\f[V]Ki\f[R] for kibi.
Used with byte unit, \f[V]1 KiB\f[R] means 1024 Byte.
In list type of output, only the unit prefix appended to the value (e.g.
\f[V]9.762Ki\f[R]), while in more textual output the full unit is shown
(e.g.
\f[V]9.762 KiB\f[R]).
For counts the SI standard notation is used, e.g.
prefix \f[V]k\f[R] for kilo.
Used with file counts, \f[V]1k\f[R] means 1000 files.
The various list (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ls/) commands
output raw numbers by default.
Option \f[V]--human-readable\f[R] will make them output values in
human-readable format instead (with the short unit prefix).
The about (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/) command outputs
human-readable by default, with a command-specific option
\f[V]--full\f[R] to output the raw numbers instead.
Command size (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_size/) outputs both
human-readable and raw numbers in the same output.
The tree (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_tree/) command also
considers \f[V]--human-readable\f[R], but it will not use the exact same
notation as the other commands: It rounds to one decimal, and uses
single letter suffix, e.g.
\f[V]K\f[R] instead of \f[V]Ki\f[R].
The reason for this is that it relies on an external library.
The interactive command ncdu (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_ncdu/)
shows human-readable by default, and responds to key \f[V]u\f[R] for
toggling human-readable format.
.SS --ignore-case-sync
Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files when
synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the existing
filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.
.SS --ignore-checksum
Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error \[dq]corrupted on transfer\[dq] if they
don\[aq]t.
.PP
You can use this option to skip that check.
You should only use it if you have had the \[dq]corrupted on
transfer\[dq] error message and you are sure you might want to transfer
potentially corrupted data.
.SS --ignore-existing
.PP
Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.
.PP
While this isn\[aq]t a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption.
However, it cannot correct partial transfers in case a transfer was
interrupted.
.PP
When performing a \f[V]move\f[R]/\f[V]moveto\f[R] command, this flag
will leave skipped files in the source location unchanged when a file
with the same name exists on the destination.
.SS --ignore-size
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the modification time.
If \f[V]--checksum\f[R] is set then it only checks the checksum.
.PP
It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.
.PP
This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
#399 (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/399) for more info).
.SS -I, --ignore-times
.PP
Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.
.PP
Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
\f[V]--checksum\f[R]).
.SS --immutable
.PP
Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.
.PP
With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated.
If an existing file does not match between the source and destination,
rclone will give the error
\f[V]Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified\f[R].
.PP
Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g.
sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/)) are affected by this
behavior, and only modification is disallowed.
Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g.
delete (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_delete/),
purge (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_purge/)) or implicitly (e.g.
sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/)).
Use \f[V]copy --immutable\f[R] if it is desired to avoid deletion as
well as modification.
This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or
append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.
.SS --inplace
The \f[V]--inplace\f[R] flag changes the behaviour of rclone when
uploading files to some backends (backends with the
\f[V]PartialUploads\f[R] feature flag set) such as:
.IP \[bu] 2
local
.IP \[bu] 2
ftp
.IP \[bu] 2
sftp
.IP \[bu] 2
pcloud
Without \f[V]--inplace\f[R] (the default) rclone will first upload to a
temporary file with an extension like this, where \f[V]XXXXXX\f[R]
represents a hash of the source file\[aq]s fingerprint and
\f[V].partial\f[R] is --partial-suffix value (\f[V].partial\f[R] by
default).
original-file-name.XXXXXX.partial
(rclone will make sure the final name is no longer than 100 characters
by truncating the \f[V]original-file-name\f[R] part if necessary).
When the upload is complete, rclone will rename the \f[V].partial\f[R]
file to the correct name, overwriting any existing file at that point.
If the upload fails then the \f[V].partial\f[R] file will be deleted.
This prevents other users of the backend from seeing partially uploaded
files in their new names and prevents overwriting the old file until the
new one is completely uploaded.
If the \f[V]--inplace\f[R] flag is supplied, rclone will upload directly
to the final name without creating a \f[V].partial\f[R] file.
This means that an incomplete file will be visible in the directory
listings while the upload is in progress and any existing files will be
overwritten as soon as the upload starts.
If the transfer fails then the file will be deleted.
This can cause data loss of the existing file if the transfer fails.
Note that on the local file system if you don\[aq]t use
\f[V]--inplace\f[R] hard links (Unix only) will be broken.
And if you do use \f[V]--inplace\f[R] you won\[aq]t be able to update in
use executables.
Note also that versions of rclone prior to v1.63.0 behave as if the
\f[V]--inplace\f[R] flag is always supplied.
.SS -i, --interactive
This flag can be used to tell rclone that you wish a manual confirmation
before destructive operations.
It is \f[B]recommended\f[R] that you use this flag while learning rclone
especially with \f[V]rclone sync\f[R].
.PP
For example
$ rclone delete --interactive /tmp/dir
rclone: delete \[dq]important-file.txt\[dq]?
y) Yes, this is OK (default)
n) No, skip this
s) Skip all delete operations with no more questions
!) Do all delete operations with no more questions
q) Exit rclone now.
y/n/s/!/q> n
The options mean
\f[V]y\f[R]: \f[B]Yes\f[R], this operation should go ahead.
You can also press Return for this to happen.
You\[aq]ll be asked every time unless you choose \f[V]s\f[R] or
\f[V]!\f[R].
\f[V]n\f[R]: \f[B]No\f[R], do not do this operation.
You\[aq]ll be asked every time unless you choose \f[V]s\f[R] or
\f[V]!\f[R].
\f[V]s\f[R]: \f[B]Skip\f[R] all the following operations of this type
with no more questions.
This takes effect until rclone exits.
If there are any different kind of operations you\[aq]ll be prompted for
them.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]!\f[R]: \f[B]Do all\f[R] the following operations with no more
questions.
Useful if you\[aq]ve decided that you don\[aq]t mind rclone doing that
kind of operation.
This takes effect until rclone exits .
If there are any different kind of operations you\[aq]ll be prompted for
them.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]q\f[R]: \f[B]Quit\f[R] rclone now, just in case!
.SS --leave-root
During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it\[aq]s empty.
.SS -l, --links
Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).
Ignored files won\[aq]t be copied, moved or deleted in a sync.
If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from any
supported backend backend, and store them as text files, with a
\f[V].rclonelink\f[R] suffix in the destination.
The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link.
The \f[V]--links\f[R] / \f[V]-l\f[R] flag enables this feature for all
supported backends and the VFS.
There are individual flags for just enabling it for the VFS
\f[V]--vfs-links\f[R] and the local backend \f[V]--local-links\f[R] if
required.
.SS --list-cutoff int
When syncing rclone needs to sort directory entries before comparing
them.
Below this threshold (1,000,000) by default, rclone will store the
directory entries in memory.
1,000,000 entries will take approx 1GB of RAM to store.
Above this threshold rclone will store directory entries on disk and
sort them without using a lot of memory.
Doing this is slightly less efficient then sorting them in memory and
will only work well for the bucket based backends (eg s3, b2, azureblob,
swift) but these are the only backends likely to have millions of
entries in a directory.
.SS --log-file string
Log all of rclone\[aq]s output to a file.
This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination
with the \f[V]-v\f[R] flag.
See the logging section for more info.
If the file exists, then rclone will append to it.
Note that if you are using the \f[V]logrotate\f[R] program to manage
rclone\[aq]s logs, then you should use the \f[V]copytruncate\f[R] option
as rclone doesn\[aq]t have a signal to rotate logs.
Alternatively you can use the options below to manage rclone\[aq]s built
in log rotation.
.SS --log-file-max-size SizeSuffix
Maximum size of the log file before it\[aq]s rotated (eg \f[V]10M\f[R]).
This SizeSuffix is rounded to the nearest MiB or 1 MiB if lower.
If \f[V]--log-file\f[R] is not set then this option will be ignored.
If this option is not set, then the other log rotation options will be
ignored.
For example if the following flags are in use
rclone --log-file rclone.log --log-file-max-size 1M --log-file-max-backups 3
Then this will create log files which look like this
$ ls -l
-rw-------  1 user user  1048491 Apr 11 17:15 rclone-2025-04-11T17-15-29.998.log
-rw-------  1 user user  1048511 Apr 11 17:15 rclone-2025-04-11T17-15-30.467.log
-rw-------  1 user user  1048559 Apr 11 17:15 rclone-2025-04-11T17-15-30.543.log
-rw-------  1 user user   521602 Apr 11 17:15 rclone.log
The file \f[V]rclone.log\f[R] being the current one.
.SS --log-file-compress
If set, compress rotated log files using gzip.
This changes the extension of the old log files to \f[V].log.gz\f[R].
Defaults to false - don\[aq]t compress log files.
.SS --log-file-max-age Duration
Maximum duration to retain old log files (eg \f[V]7d\f[R]).
This is rounded to the dearest day, or 1 day if lower.
The default is to retain all old log files.
.SS --log-file-max-backups int
Maximum number of old log files to retain
The default is to retain all old log files.
.SS --log-format string
Comma separated list of log format options.
The accepted options are:
\f[V]date\f[R] - Add a date in the format YYYY/MM/YY to the log.
\f[V]time\f[R] - Add a time to the log in format HH:MM:SS.
\f[V]microseconds\f[R] - Add microseconds to the time in format
HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS.
\f[V]UTC\f[R] - Make the logs in UTC not localtime.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]longfile\f[R] - Adds the source file and line number of the log
statement.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]shortfile\f[R] - Adds the source file and line number of the log
statement.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]pid\f[R] - Add the process ID to the log - useful with
\f[V]rclone mount --daemon\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]nolevel\f[R] - Don\[aq]t add the level to the log.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]json\f[R] - Equivalent to adding \f[V]--use-json-log\f[R]
They are added to the log line in the order above.
The default log format is \f[V]\[dq]date,time\[dq]\f[R].
.SS --log-level LogLevel
This sets the log level for rclone.
The default log level is \f[V]NOTICE\f[R].
\f[V]DEBUG\f[R] is equivalent to \f[V]-vv\f[R].
It outputs lots of debug info - useful for bug reports and really
finding out what rclone is doing.
\f[V]INFO\f[R] is equivalent to \f[V]-v\f[R].
It outputs information about each transfer and prints stats once a
minute by default.
\f[V]NOTICE\f[R] is the default log level if no logging flags are
supplied.
It outputs very little when things are working normally.
It outputs warnings and significant events.
\f[V]ERROR\f[R] is equivalent to \f[V]-q\f[R].
It only outputs error messages.
See also the logging section.
.SS --windows-event-log LogLevel
If this is configured (the default is \f[V]OFF\f[R]) then logs of this
level and above will be logged to the Windows event log in
\f[B]addition\f[R] to the normal logs.
These will be logged in JSON format as described below regardless of
what format the main logs are configured for.
The Windows event log only has 3 levels of severity \f[V]Info\f[R],
\f[V]Warning\f[R] and \f[V]Error\f[R].
If enabled we map rclone levels like this.
\f[V]Error\f[R] ← \f[V]ERROR\f[R] (and above)
\f[V]Warning\f[R] ← \f[V]WARNING\f[R] (note that this level is defined
but not currently used).
\f[V]Info\f[R] ← \f[V]NOTICE\f[R], \f[V]INFO\f[R] and \f[V]DEBUG\f[R].
Rclone will declare its log source as \[dq]rclone\[dq] if it is has
enough permissions to create the registry key needed.
If not then logs will appear as \[dq]Application\[dq].
You can run \f[V]rclone version --windows-event-log DEBUG\f[R] once as
administrator to create the registry key in advance.
\f[B]Note\f[R] that the \f[V]--windows-event-log\f[R] level must be
greater (more severe) than or equal to the \f[V]--log-level\f[R].
For example to log DEBUG to a log file but ERRORs to the event log you
would use
--log-file rclone.log --log-level DEBUG --windows-event-log ERROR
This option is only supported Windows platforms.
.SS --use-json-log
This switches the log format to JSON.
The log messages are then streamed as individual JSON objects, with
fields: \f[V]level\f[R], \f[V]msg\f[R], \f[V]source\f[R], and
\f[V]time\f[R].
The resulting format is what is sometimes referred to as
newline-delimited
JSON (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Newline-delimited_JSON)
(NDJSON), or JSON Lines (JSONL).
This is well suited for processing by traditional line-oriented tools
and shell pipelines, but a complete log file is not strictly valid JSON
and needs a parser that can handle it.
The JSON logs will be printed on a single line, but are shown expanded
here for clarity.
{

  \[dq]msg\[dq]: \[dq]4 go routines active\[rs]n\[dq],
  \[dq]source\[dq]: \[dq]cmd/cmd.go:298\[dq]
}
Completed data transfer logs will have extra \f[V]size\f[R] information.
Logs which are about a particular object will have \f[V]object\f[R] and
\f[V]objectType\f[R] fields also.

.SS --low-level-retries int
This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.
A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one
HTTP request.
This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the \f[V]-v\f[R] flag.
This shouldn\[aq]t need to be changed from the default in normal
operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce
the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
\f[V]--retries\f[R] flag) quicker.
Disable low level retries with \f[V]--low-level-retries 1\f[R].
.SS --max-backlog int
This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.
This can be set arbitrarily large.
It will only use memory when the queue is in use.
Note that it will use in the order of N KiB of memory when the backlog
is in use.
Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are pending
more accurately, give a more accurate estimated finish time and make
\f[V]--order-by\f[R] work more accurately.
Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings of
the remote which may be desirable.
Setting this to a negative number will make the backlog as large as
possible.
.SS --max-buffer-memory SizeSuffix
If set, don\[aq]t allocate more than given amount of memory as buffers.
If not set or set to \f[V]0\f[R] or \f[V]off\f[R] this will not limit
the amount of memory in use.
This includes memory used by buffers created by the \f[V]--buffer\f[R]
flag and buffers used by multi-thread transfers.
Most multi-thread transfers do not take additional memory, but some do
depending on the backend (eg the s3 backend for uploads).
This means there is a tension between total setting
\f[V]--transfers\f[R] as high as possible and memory use.
Setting \f[V]--max-buffer-memory\f[R] allows the buffer memory to be
controlled so that it doesn\[aq]t overwhelm the machine and allows
\f[V]--transfers\f[R] to be set large.
.SS --max-connections int
This sets the maximum number of concurrent calls to the backend API.
It may not map 1:1 to TCP or HTTP connections depending on the backend
in use and the use of HTTP1 vs HTTP2.
When downloading files, backends only limit the initial opening of the
stream.
The bulk data download is not counted as a connection.
This means that the \f[V]--max--connections\f[R] flag won\[aq]t limit
the total number of downloads.
Note that it is possible to cause deadlocks with this setting so it
should be used with care.
If you are doing a sync or copy then make sure
\f[V]--max-connections\f[R] is one more than the sum of
\f[V]--transfers\f[R] and \f[V]--checkers\f[R].
If you use \f[V]--check-first\f[R] then \f[V]--max-connections\f[R] just
needs to be one more than the maximum of \f[V]--checkers\f[R] and
\f[V]--transfers\f[R].
So for \f[V]--max-connections 3\f[R] you\[aq]d use
\f[V]--checkers 2 --transfers 2 --check-first\f[R] or
\f[V]--checkers 1 --transfers 1\f[R].
Setting this flag can be useful for backends which do multipart uploads
to limit the number of simultaneous parts being transferred.
.SS --max-delete int
This tells rclone not to delete more than N files.
If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and
rclone will stop the operation in progress.
.SS --max-delete-size SizeSuffix
Rclone will stop deleting files when the total size of deletions has
reached the size specified.
It defaults to off.
If that limit is exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and
rclone will stop the operation in progress.
.SS --max-depth int
This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.
So if you do \f[V]rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path\f[R] you will see
only the files in the top level directory.
Using \f[V]--max-depth 2\f[R] means you will see all the files in first
two directory levels and so on.
.PP
For historical reasons the \f[V]lsd\f[R] command defaults to using a
\f[V]--max-depth\f[R] of 1 - you can override this with the command line
flag.
.PP
You can use this command to disable recursion (with
\f[V]--max-depth 1\f[R]).
.PP
Note that if you use this with \f[V]sync\f[R] and
\f[V]--delete-excluded\f[R] the files not recursed through are
considered excluded and will be deleted on the destination.
Test first with \f[V]--dry-run\f[R] if you are not sure what will
happen.
.SS --max-duration Duration
.PP
Rclone will stop transferring when it has run for the duration
specified.
Defaults to off.
.PP
When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.
Use \f[V]--cutoff-mode\f[R] to modify this behaviour.
.PP
Rclone will exit with exit code 10 if the duration limit is reached.
.SS --max-transfer SizeSuffix
.PP
Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.
.PP
When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.
Use \f[V]--cutoff-mode\f[R] to modify this behaviour.
.PP
Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.
.SS --cutoff-mode HARD|SOFT|CAUTIOUS
.PP
Configure the behavior of \f[V]--max-transfer\f[R] and
\f[V]--max-duration\f[R].
.PP
\f[V]HARD\f[R] will stop transferring immediately when rclone reaches
the limit.
This is the default.
.PP
\f[V]SOFT\f[R] will stop starting new transfers when rclone reaches the
limit.
.PP
\f[V]CAUTIOUS\f[R] will try to prevent rclone from reaching the limit.
Only applicable for \f[V]--max-transfer\f[R].
.SS -M, --metadata
.PP
Setting this flag enables rclone to copy the metadata from the source to
the destination.
For local backends this is ownership, permissions, xattr etc.
See the metadata section for more info.
.SS --metadata-mapper SpaceSepList
.PP
If you supply the parameter \f[V]--metadata-mapper /path/to/program\f[R]
then rclone will use that program to map metadata from source object to
destination object.
.PP
The argument to this flag should be a command with an optional space
separated list of arguments.
If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it in
\f[V]\[dq]\f[R], if you want a literal \f[V]\[dq]\f[R] in an argument
then enclose the argument in \f[V]\[dq]\f[R] and double the
\f[V]\[dq]\f[R].
See CSV encoding (https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) for more info.
--metadata-mapper \[dq]python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py\[dq]
--metadata-mapper \[aq]python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py \[dq]argument with a space\[dq]\[aq]
--metadata-mapper \[aq]python bin/test_metadata_mapper.py \[dq]argument with \[dq]\[dq]two\[dq]\[dq] quotes\[dq]\[aq]
This uses a simple JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on
STDOUT.
This will be called for every file and directory copied and may be
called concurrently.
.PP
The program\[aq]s job is to take a metadata blob on the input and turn
it into a metadata blob on the output suitable for the destination
backend.
.PP
Input to the program (via STDIN) might look like this.
This provides some context for the \f[V]Metadata\f[R] which may be
important.

    \[dq]description\[dq]: \[dq]my nice file\[dq],
    \[dq]starred\[dq]: \[dq]false\[dq]
  }
}
The program should then modify the input as desired and send it to
STDOUT.
The returned \f[V]Metadata\f[R] field will be used in its entirety for
the destination object.
Any other fields will be ignored.
Note in this example we translate user names and permissions and add
something to the description:
{
  \[dq]Metadata\[dq]: {
    \[dq]btime\[dq]: \[dq]2022-10-11T16:53:11Z\[dq],
    \[dq]content-type\[dq]: \[dq]text/plain; charset=utf-8\[dq],

    \[dq]permissions\[dq]: \[dq]...\[dq],
    \[dq]description\[dq]: \[dq]my nice file [migrated from domain1]\[dq],
    \[dq]starred\[dq]: \[dq]false\[dq]
  }
}
Metadata can be removed here too.
An example python program might look something like this to implement
the above transformations.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
import sys, json

i = json.load(sys.stdin)
metadata = i[\[dq]Metadata\[dq]]
# Add tag to description
if \[dq]description\[dq] in metadata:
    metadata[\[dq]description\[dq]] += \[dq] [migrated from domain1]\[dq]
else:
    metadata[\[dq]description\[dq]] = \[dq][migrated from domain1]\[dq]
# Modify owner
if \[dq]owner\[dq] in metadata:
    metadata[\[dq]owner\[dq]] = metadata[\[dq]owner\[dq]].replace(\[dq]domain1.com\[dq], \[dq]domain2.com\[dq])
o = { \[dq]Metadata\[dq]: metadata }
json.dump(o, sys.stdout, indent=\[dq]\[rs]t\[dq])
\f[R]
.fi
You can find this example (slightly expanded) in the rclone source code
at
bin/test_metadata_mapper.py (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/bin/test_metadata_mapper.py).
If you want to see the input to the metadata mapper and the output
returned from it in the log you can use \f[V]-vv --dump mapper\f[R].
See the metadata section for more info.
.SS --metadata-set stringArray
Specify value as string in format \f[V]key=value\f[R] to add metadata
\f[V]key\f[R] with value \f[V]value\f[R] when uploading.
This can be repeated as many times as required.
See the metadata section for more info.
.SS --modify-window Duration
When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.
The default is \f[V]1ns\f[R] unless this is overridden by a remote.
For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
\f[V]1s\f[R] by default.
This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.
.SS --multi-thread-write-buffer-size SizeSuffix
When transferring with multiple threads, rclone will buffer the
specified number of bytes in memory before writing to disk for each
thread.
This can improve performance if the underlying filesystem does not deal
well with a lot of small writes in different positions of the file, so
if you see transfers being limited by disk write speed, you might want
to experiment with different values.
Specially for magnetic drives and remote file systems a higher value can
be useful.
Nevertheless, the default of \f[V]128k\f[R] should be fine for almost
all use cases, so before changing it ensure that network is not really
your bottleneck.
As a final hint, size is not the only factor: block size (or similar
concept) can have an impact.
In one case, we observed that exact multiples of 16k performed much
better than other values.
.SS --multi-thread-chunk-size SizeSuffix
Normally the chunk size for multi thread transfers is set by the
backend.
However some backends such as \f[V]local\f[R] and \f[V]smb\f[R] (which
implement \f[V]OpenWriterAt\f[R] but not \f[V]OpenChunkWriter\f[R])
don\[aq]t have a natural chunk size.
In this case the value of this option is used (default 64Mi).
.SS --multi-thread-cutoff SizeSuffix
When transferring files above specified size to capable backends, rclone
will use multiple threads to transfer the file (default 256M).
Capable backends are marked in the
overview (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) as
\f[V]MultithreadUpload\f[R].
(They need to implement either the \f[V]OpenWriterAt\f[R] or
\f[V]OpenChunkWriter\f[R] internal interfaces).
These include include, \f[V]local\f[R], \f[V]s3\f[R],
\f[V]azureblob\f[R], \f[V]b2\f[R], \f[V]oracleobjectstorage\f[R] and
\f[V]smb\f[R] at the time of writing.
On the local disk, rclone preallocates the file (using
\f[V]fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)\f[R] on unix or
\f[V]NTSetInformationFile\f[R] on Windows both of which takes no time)
then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct place.
This means that rclone won\[aq]t create fragmented or sparse files and
there won\[aq]t be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.
The number of threads used to transfer is controlled by
\f[V]--multi-thread-streams\f[R].
Use \f[V]-vv\f[R] if you wish to see info about the threads.
This will work with the sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) and
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/) commands, and friends
copyto (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyto/),
moveto (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/).
Multi thread transfers will be used with \f[V]rclone mount\f[R] and
\f[V]rclone serve\f[R] if \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] is set to
\f[V]writes\f[R] or above.
Most multi-thread transfers do not take additional memory, but some do
(for example uploading to s3).
In the worst case memory usage can be at maximum \f[V]--transfers\f[R] *
\f[V]--multi-thread-chunk-size\f[R] * \f[V]--multi-thread-streams\f[R]
or specifically for the s3 backend \f[V]--transfers\f[R] *
\f[V]--s3-chunk-size\f[R] * \f[V]--s3-concurrency\f[R].
However you can use the the
--max-buffer-memory (https://rclone.org/docs/#max-buffer-memory) flag to
control the maximum memory used here.
\f[B]NB\f[R] that this \f[B]only\f[R] works with supported backends as
the destination but will work with any backend as the source.
\f[B]NB\f[R] that multi-thread copies are disabled for local to local
copies as they are faster without unless
\f[V]--multi-thread-streams\f[R] is set explicitly.
.PP
\f[B]NB\f[R] on Windows using multi-thread transfers to the local disk
will cause the resulting files to be
sparse (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file).
Use \f[V]--local-no-sparse\f[R] to disable sparse files (which may cause
long delays at the start of transfers) or disable multi-thread transfers
with \f[V]--multi-thread-streams 0\f[R]
.SS --multi-thread-streams int
.PP
When using multi thread transfers (see above
\f[V]--multi-thread-cutoff\f[R]) this sets the number of streams to use.
Set to \f[V]0\f[R] to disable multi thread transfers (Default 4).
.PP
If the backend has a \f[V]--backend-upload-concurrency\f[R] setting (eg
\f[V]--s3-upload-concurrency\f[R]) then this setting will be used as the
number of transfers instead if it is larger than the value of
\f[V]--multi-thread-streams\f[R] or \f[V]--multi-thread-streams\f[R]
isn\[aq]t set.
.SS --name-transform stringArray
.PP
\f[V]--name-transform\f[R] introduces path name transformations for
\f[V]rclone copy\f[R], \f[V]rclone sync\f[R], and \f[V]rclone move\f[R].
These transformations enable modifications to source and destination
file names by applying prefixes, suffixes, and other alterations during
transfer operations.
For detailed docs and examples, see
\f[V]convmv\f[R] (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_convmv/).
.SS --no-check-dest
.PP
The \f[V]--no-check-dest\f[R] can be used with \f[V]move\f[R] or
\f[V]copy\f[R] and it causes rclone not to check the destination at all
when copying files.
.PP
This means that:
the destination is not listed minimising the API calls
files are always transferred
this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (e.g.
Google Drive)
\f[V]--retries 1\f[R] is recommended otherwise you\[aq]ll transfer
everything again on a retry
This flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none
of the files are on the destination.
This is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!
.SS --no-gzip-encoding
Don\[aq]t set \f[V]Accept-Encoding: gzip\f[R].
This means that rclone won\[aq]t ask the server for compressed files
automatically.
Useful if you\[aq]ve set the server to return files with
\f[V]Content-Encoding: gzip\f[R] but you uploaded compressed files.
There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.
.SS --no-traverse
The \f[V]--no-traverse\f[R] flag controls whether the destination file
system is traversed when using the \f[V]copy\f[R] or \f[V]move\f[R]
commands.
\f[V]--no-traverse\f[R] is not compatible with \f[V]sync\f[R] and will
be ignored if you supply it with \f[V]sync\f[R].
If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then \f[V]--no-traverse\f[R] will stop rclone listing the destination
and save time.
However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven\[aq]t
changed and won\[aq]t need copying then you shouldn\[aq]t use
\f[V]--no-traverse\f[R].
See rclone copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) for an
example of how to use it.
.SS --no-unicode-normalization
Don\[aq]t normalize unicode characters in filenames during the sync
routine.
Sometimes, an operating system will store filenames containing unicode
parts in their decomposed form (particularly macOS).
Some cloud storage systems will then recompose the unicode, resulting in
duplicate files if the data is ever copied back to a local filesystem.
Using this flag will disable that functionality, treating each unicode
character as unique.
For example, by default é and é will be normalized into the same
character.
With \f[V]--no-unicode-normalization\f[R] they will be treated as unique
characters.
.SS --no-update-modtime
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update modification times of
remote files if they are incorrect as it would normally.
.PP
This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(e.g.
the Google Drive client).
.SS --no-update-dir-modtime
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update modification times of
remote directories if they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS --order-by string
.PP
The \f[V]--order-by\f[R] flag controls the order in which files in the
backlog are processed in \f[V]rclone sync\f[R], \f[V]rclone copy\f[R]
and \f[V]rclone move\f[R].
.PP
The order by string is constructed like this.
The first part describes what aspect is being measured:
\f[V]size\f[R] - order by the size of the files
\f[V]name\f[R] - order by the full path of the files
\f[V]modtime\f[R] - order by the modification date of the files
.PP
This can have a modifier appended with a comma:
\f[V]ascending\f[R] or \f[V]asc\f[R] - order so that the smallest (or
oldest) is processed first
\f[V]descending\f[R] or \f[V]desc\f[R] - order so that the largest (or
newest) is processed first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]mixed\f[R] - order so that the smallest is processed first for some
threads and the largest for others
If the modifier is \f[V]mixed\f[R] then it can have an optional
percentage (which defaults to \f[V]50\f[R]), e.g.
\f[V]size,mixed,25\f[R] which means that 25% of the threads should be
taking the smallest items and 75% the largest.
The threads which take the smallest first will always take the smallest
first and likewise the largest first threads.
The \f[V]mixed\f[R] mode can be useful to minimise the transfer time
when you are transferring a mixture of large and small files - the large
files are guaranteed upload threads and bandwidth and the small files
will be processed continuously.
If no modifier is supplied then the order is \f[V]ascending\f[R].
For example
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--order-by size,desc\f[R] - send the largest files first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--order-by modtime,ascending\f[R] - send the oldest files first
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--order-by name\f[R] - send the files with alphabetically by path
first
If the \f[V]--order-by\f[R] flag is not supplied or it is supplied with
an empty string then the default ordering will be used which is as
scanned.
With \f[V]--checkers 1\f[R] this is mostly alphabetical, however with
the default \f[V]--checkers 8\f[R] it is somewhat random.
.SS Limitations
The \f[V]--order-by\f[R] flag does not do a separate pass over the data.
This means that it may transfer some files out of the order specified if
.IP \[bu] 2
there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully
scanned yet
.IP \[bu] 2
there are more than --max-backlog files in the backlog
Rclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in practice
this should not cause a problem.
Think of \f[V]--order-by\f[R] as being more of a best efforts flag
rather than a perfect ordering.
If you want perfect ordering then you will need to specify --check-first
which will find all the files which need transferring first before
transferring any.
.SS --partial-suffix string
When --inplace is not used, it causes rclone to use the
\f[V]--partial-suffix\f[R] as suffix for temporary files.
Suffix length limit is 16 characters.
The default is \f[V].partial\f[R].
.SS --password-command SpaceSepList
This flag supplies a program which should supply the config password
when run.
This is an alternative to rclone prompting for the password or setting
the \f[V]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] variable.
It is also used when setting the config password for the first time.
The argument to this should be a command with a space separated list of
arguments.
If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it in
\f[V]\[dq]\f[R], if you want a literal \f[V]\[dq]\f[R] in an argument
then enclose the argument in \f[V]\[dq]\f[R] and double the
\f[V]\[dq]\f[R].
See CSV encoding (https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) for more info.
Eg
--password-command \[dq]echo hello\[dq]
--password-command \[aq]echo \[dq]hello with space\[dq]\[aq]
--password-command \[aq]echo \[dq]hello with \[dq]\[dq]quotes\[dq]\[dq] and space\[dq]\[aq]
Note that when changing the configuration password the environment
variable \f[V]RCLONE_PASSWORD_CHANGE=1\f[R] will be set.
This can be used to distinguish initial decryption of the config file
from the new password.
See the Configuration Encryption for more info.
See a Windows PowerShell example on the
Wiki (https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Windows-Powershell-use-rclone-password-command-for-Config-file-password).
.SS -P, --progress
This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.
Any log messages will scroll above the static block.
Log messages will push the static block down to the bottom of the
terminal where it will stay.
Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the \f[V]--stats\f[R] flag.
This can be used with the \f[V]--stats-one-line\f[R] flag for a simpler
display.
To change the display length of filenames (for different terminal
widths), see the \f[V]--stats-file-name-length\f[R] option.
The default output is formatted for 80 character wide terminals.
Note: On Windows until this
bug (https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/issues/26) is fixed all
non-ASCII characters will be replaced with \f[V].\f[R] when
\f[V]--progress\f[R] is in use.
.SS --progress-terminal-title
This flag, when used with \f[V]-P/--progress\f[R], will print the string
\f[V]ETA: %s\f[R] to the terminal title.
.SS -q, --quiet
This flag will limit rclone\[aq]s output to error messages only.
.SS --refresh-times
The \f[V]--refresh-times\f[R] flag can be used to update modification
times of existing files when they are out of sync on backends which
don\[aq]t support hashes.
This is useful if you uploaded files with the incorrect timestamps and
you now wish to correct them.
This flag is \f[B]only\f[R] useful for destinations which don\[aq]t
support hashes (e.g.
\f[V]crypt\f[R]).
This can be used any of the sync commands
sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) or
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/).
To use this flag you will need to be doing a modification time sync (so
not using \f[V]--size-only\f[R] or \f[V]--checksum\f[R]).
The flag will have no effect when using \f[V]--size-only\f[R] or
\f[V]--checksum\f[R].
If this flag is used when rclone comes to upload a file it will check to
see if there is an existing file on the destination.
If this file matches the source with size (and checksum if available)
but has a differing timestamp then instead of re-uploading it, rclone
will update the timestamp on the destination file.
If the checksum does not match rclone will upload the new file.
If the checksum is absent (e.g.
on a \f[V]crypt\f[R] backend) then rclone will update the timestamp.
Note that some remotes can\[aq]t set the modification time without
re-uploading the file so this flag is less useful on them.
Normally if you are doing a modification time sync rclone will update
modification times without \f[V]--refresh-times\f[R] provided that the
remote supports checksums \f[B]and\f[R] the checksums match on the file.
However if the checksums are absent then rclone will upload the file
rather than setting the timestamp as this is the safe behaviour.
.SS --retries int
Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).
Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files
which didn\[aq]t get transferred because of errors.
Disable retries with \f[V]--retries 1\f[R].
.SS --retries-sleep Duration
This sets the interval between each retry specified by
\f[V]--retries\f[R]
The default is \f[V]0\f[R].
Use \f[V]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS --server-side-across-configs
Allow server-side operations (e.g.
copy or move) to work across different configurations.
.PP
This can be useful if you wish to do a server-side copy or move between
two remotes which use the same backend but are configured differently.
.PP
Note that this isn\[aq]t enabled by default because it isn\[aq]t easy
for rclone to tell if it will work between any two configurations.
.SS --size-only
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.
.PP
This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn\[aq]t set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.
.SS --stats Duration
.PP
Commands which transfer data
(sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/),
copyto (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copyto/),
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/),
moveto (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_moveto/)) will print data
transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.
.PP
This sets the interval.
.PP
The default is \f[V]1m\f[R].
Use \f[V]0\f[R] to disable.
.PP
If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats.
This can be useful when running other commands, \f[V]check\f[R] or
\f[V]mount\f[R] for example.
.PP
Stats are logged at \f[V]INFO\f[R] level by default which means they
won\[aq]t show at default log level \f[V]NOTICE\f[R].
Use \f[V]--stats-log-level NOTICE\f[R] or \f[V]-v\f[R] to make them
show.
See the logging section for more info on log levels.
.PP
Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.
.SS --stats-file-name-length int
.PP
By default, the \f[V]--stats\f[R] output will truncate file names and
paths longer than 40 characters.
This is equivalent to providing \f[V]--stats-file-name-length 40\f[R].
Use \f[V]--stats-file-name-length 0\f[R] to disable any truncation of
file names printed by stats.
.SS --stats-log-level LogLevel
.PP
Log level to show \f[V]--stats\f[R] output at.
This can be \f[V]DEBUG\f[R], \f[V]INFO\f[R], \f[V]NOTICE\f[R], or
\f[V]ERROR\f[R].
The default is \f[V]INFO\f[R].
This means at the default level of logging, which is \f[V]NOTICE\f[R],
the stats won\[aq]t show - if you want them to then use
\f[V]--stats-log-level NOTICE\f[R].
See the logging section for more details on log levels.
.SS --stats-one-line
.PP
When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.
.SS --stats-one-line-date
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a date string.
The default is \f[V]2006/01/02 15:04:05 -\f[R]
.SS --stats-one-line-date-format string
.PP
When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a user-supplied date string.
The date string MUST be enclosed in quotes.
Follow golang specs (https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format) for date
formatting syntax.
.SS --stats-unit string
.PP
By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes per second,
corresponding to \f[V]--stats-unit bytes\f[R].
.PP
This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits per second, by
specifying \f[V]--stats-unit bits\f[R].
Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.
.PP
The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit.
So 1 Mbit/s equals 1,048,576 bit/s and not 1,000,000 bit/s.
.SS --suffix string
.PP
When using sync (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/),
copy (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) or
move (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/) any files which would
have been overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added to them.
If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added),
then it will be overwritten.
.PP
The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.
.PP
This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory or
with \f[V]--backup-dir\f[R].
See \f[V]--backup-dir\f[R] for more info.
.PP
For example
rclone copy --interactive /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak
will copy \f[V]/path/to/local\f[R] to \f[V]remote:current\f[R], but for
any files which would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.
.PP
If using \f[V]rclone sync\f[R] with \f[V]--suffix\f[R] and without
\f[V]--backup-dir\f[R] then it is recommended to put a filter rule in
excluding the suffix otherwise the \f[V]sync\f[R] will delete the backup
files.
rclone sync --interactive /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak --exclude \[dq]*.bak\[dq]
.SS --suffix-keep-extension
When using \f[V]--suffix\f[R], setting this causes rclone put the SUFFIX
before the extension of the files that it backs up rather than after.
So let\[aq]s say we had \f[V]--suffix -2019-01-01\f[R], without the flag
\f[V]file.txt\f[R] would be backed up to \f[V]file.txt-2019-01-01\f[R]
and with the flag it would be backed up to
\f[V]file-2019-01-01.txt\f[R].
This can be helpful to make sure the suffixed files can still be opened.
If a file has two (or more) extensions and the second (or subsequent)
extension is recognised as a valid mime type, then the suffix will go
before that extension.
So \f[V]file.tar.gz\f[R] would be backed up to
\f[V]file-2019-01-01.tar.gz\f[R] whereas \f[V]file.badextension.gz\f[R]
would be backed up to \f[V]file.badextension-2019-01-01.gz\f[R].
.SS --syslog
On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.
This can be useful for running rclone in a script or
\f[V]rclone mount\f[R].
.SS --syslog-facility string
If using \f[V]--syslog\f[R] this sets the syslog facility (e.g.
\f[V]KERN\f[R], \f[V]USER\f[R]).
See \f[V]man syslog\f[R] for a list of possible facilities.
The default facility is \f[V]DAEMON\f[R].
.SS --temp-dir string
Specify the directory rclone will use for temporary files, to override
the default.
Make sure the directory exists and have accessible permissions.
By default the operating system\[aq]s temp directory will be used:
.IP \[bu] 2
On Unix systems, \f[V]$TMPDIR\f[R] if non-empty, else \f[V]/tmp\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
On Windows, the first non-empty value from \f[V]%TMP%\f[R],
\f[V]%TEMP%\f[R], \f[V]%USERPROFILE%\f[R], or the Windows directory.
When overriding the default with this option, the specified path will be
set as value of environment variable \f[V]TMPDIR\f[R] on Unix systems
and \f[V]TMP\f[R] and \f[V]TEMP\f[R] on Windows.
You can use the config
paths (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/) command to see
the current value.
.SS --tpslimit float
Limit transactions per second to this number.
Default is 0 which is used to mean unlimited transactions per second.
A transaction is roughly defined as an API call; its exact meaning will
depend on the backend.
For HTTP based backends it is an HTTP PUT/GET/POST/etc and its response.
For FTP/SFTP it is a round trip transaction over TCP.
For example, to limit rclone to 10 transactions per second use
\f[V]--tpslimit 10\f[R], or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use
\f[V]--tpslimit 0.5\f[R].
Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (e.g.
getting you banned or rate limited).
This can be very useful for \f[V]rclone mount\f[R] to control the
behaviour of applications using it.
This limit applies to all HTTP based backends and to the FTP and SFTP
backends.
It does not apply to the local backend or the Storj backend.
See also \f[V]--tpslimit-burst\f[R].
.SS --tpslimit-burst int
Max burst of transactions for \f[V]--tpslimit\f[R] (default
\f[V]1\f[R]).
Normally \f[V]--tpslimit\f[R] will do exactly the number of transaction
per second specified.
However if you supply \f[V]--tps-burst\f[R] then rclone can save up some
transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the parameter
supplied.
For example if you provide \f[V]--tpslimit-burst 10\f[R] then if rclone
has been idle for more than 10*\f[V]--tpslimit\f[R] then it can do 10
transactions very quickly before they are limited again.
This may be used to increase performance of \f[V]--tpslimit\f[R] without
changing the long term average number of transactions per second.
.SS --track-renames
By default, rclone doesn\[aq]t keep track of renamed files, so if you
rename a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the
old file on the remote and upload a new copy.
An rclone sync with \f[V]--track-renames\f[R] runs like a normal sync,
but keeps track of objects which exist in the destination but not in the
source (which would normally be deleted), and which objects exist in the
source but not the destination (which would normally be transferred).
These objects are then candidates for renaming.
After the sync, rclone matches up the source only and destination only
objects using the \f[V]--track-renames-strategy\f[R] specified and
either renames the destination object or transfers the source and
deletes the destination object.
\f[V]--track-renames\f[R] is stateless like all of rclone\[aq]s syncs.
To use this flag the destination must support server-side copy or
server-side move, and to use a hash based
\f[V]--track-renames-strategy\f[R] (the default) the source and the
destination must have a compatible hash.
If the destination does not support server-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.
Encrypted destinations are not currently supported by
\f[V]--track-renames\f[R] if \f[V]--track-renames-strategy\f[R] includes
\f[V]hash\f[R].
Note that \f[V]--track-renames\f[R] is incompatible with
\f[V]--no-traverse\f[R] and that it uses extra memory to keep track of
all the rename candidates.
Note also that \f[V]--track-renames\f[R] is incompatible with
\f[V]--delete-before\f[R] and will select \f[V]--delete-after\f[R]
instead of \f[V]--delete-during\f[R].
.SS --track-renames-strategy string
This option changes the file matching criteria for
\f[V]--track-renames\f[R].
The matching is controlled by a comma separated selection of these
tokens:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]modtime\f[R] - the modification time of the file - not supported on
all backends
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]hash\f[R] - the hash of the file contents - not supported on all
backends
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]leaf\f[R] - the name of the file not including its directory name
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]size\f[R] - the size of the file (this is always enabled)
The default option is \f[V]hash\f[R].
Using \f[V]--track-renames-strategy modtime,leaf\f[R] would match files
based on modification time, the leaf of the file name and the size only.
Using \f[V]--track-renames-strategy modtime\f[R] or \f[V]leaf\f[R] can
enable \f[V]--track-renames\f[R] support for encrypted destinations.
Note that the \f[V]hash\f[R] strategy is not supported with encrypted
destinations.
.SS --delete-(before,during,after)
This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.
Specifying the value \f[V]--delete-before\f[R] will delete all files
present on the destination, but not on the source \f[I]before\f[R]
starting the transfer of any new or updated files.
This uses two passes through the file systems, one for the deletions and
one for the copies.
Specifying \f[V]--delete-during\f[R] will delete files while checking
and uploading files.
This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.
Specifying \f[V]--delete-after\f[R] (the default value) will delay
deletion of files until all new/updated files have been successfully
transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully.
The files to be deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more
memory.
This is the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been
no errors subsequent to that.
If there have been errors before the deletions start then you will get
the message \f[V]not deleting files as there were IO errors\f[R].
.SS --fast-list
When doing anything which involves a directory listing (e.g.
\f[V]sync\f[R], \f[V]copy\f[R], \f[V]ls\f[R] - in fact nearly every
command), rclone has different strategies to choose from.
The basic strategy is to list one directory and processes it before
using more directory lists to process any subdirectories.
This is a mandatory backend feature, called \f[V]List\f[R], which means
it is supported by all backends.
This strategy uses small amount of memory, and because it can be
parallelised it is fast for operations involving processing of the list
results.
Some backends provide the support for an alternative strategy, where all
files beneath a directory can be listed in one (or a small number) of
transactions.
Rclone supports this alternative strategy through an optional backend
feature called \f[V]ListR\f[R] (https://rclone.org/overview/#listr).
You can see in the storage system overview documentation\[aq]s optional
features (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) section which
backends it is enabled for (these tend to be the bucket-based ones, e.g.
S3, B2, GCS, Swift).
This strategy requires fewer transactions for highly recursive
operations, which is important on backends where this is charged or
heavily rate limited.
It may be faster (due to fewer transactions) or slower (because it
can\[aq]t be parallelized) depending on different parameters, and may
require more memory if rclone has to keep the whole listing in memory.
Which listing strategy rclone picks for a given operation is
complicated, but in general it tries to choose the best possible.
It will prefer \f[V]ListR\f[R] in situations where it doesn\[aq]t need
to store the listed files in memory, e.g.
for unlimited recursive \f[V]ls\f[R] command variants.
In other situations it will prefer \f[V]List\f[R], e.g.
for \f[V]sync\f[R] and \f[V]copy\f[R], where it needs to keep the listed
files in memory, and is performing operations on them where
parallelization may be a huge advantage.
Rclone is not able to take all relevant parameters into account for
deciding the best strategy, and therefore allows you to influence the
choice in two ways: You can stop rclone from using \f[V]ListR\f[R] by
disabling the feature, using the --disable option
(\f[V]--disable ListR\f[R]), or you can allow rclone to use
\f[V]ListR\f[R] where it would normally choose not to do so due to
higher memory usage, using the \f[V]--fast-list\f[R] option.
Rclone should always produce identical results either way.
Using \f[V]--disable ListR\f[R] or \f[V]--fast-list\f[R] on a remote
which doesn\[aq]t support \f[V]ListR\f[R] does nothing, rclone will just
ignore it.
A rule of thumb is that if you pay for transactions and can fit your
entire sync listing into memory, then \f[V]--fast-list\f[R] is
recommended.
If you have a very big sync to do, then don\[aq]t use
\f[V]--fast-list\f[R], otherwise you will run out of memory.
Run some tests and compare before you decide, and if in doubt then just
leave the default, let rclone decide, i.e.
not use \f[V]--fast-list\f[R].
.SS --timeout Duration
This sets the IO idle timeout.
If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is
considered broken and disconnected.
The default is \f[V]5m\f[R].
Set to \f[V]0\f[R] to disable.
.SS --transfers int
The number of file transfers to run in parallel.
It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote
is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and
a fast remote.
The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.
Look at --multi-thread-streams if you would like to control single file
transfers.
.SS -u, --update
This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.
This can be useful in avoiding needless transfers when transferring to a
remote which doesn\[aq]t support modification times directly (or when
using \f[V]--use-server-modtime\f[R] to avoid extra API calls) as it is
more accurate than a \f[V]--size-only\f[R] check and faster than using
\f[V]--checksum\f[R].
On such remotes (or when using \f[V]--use-server-modtime\f[R]) the time
checked will be the uploaded time.
If an existing destination file has a modification time older than the
source file\[aq]s, it will be updated if the sizes are different.
If the sizes are the same, it will be updated if the checksum is
different or not available.
If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window) to the source file\[aq]s, it will be updated
if the sizes are different.
The checksum will not be checked in this case unless the
\f[V]--checksum\f[R] flag is provided.
In all other cases the file will not be updated.
Consider using the \f[V]--modify-window\f[R] flag to compensate for time
skews between the source and the backend, for backends that do not
support mod times, and instead use uploaded times.
However, if the backend does not support checksums, note that syncing or
copying within the time skew window may still result in additional
transfers for safety.
.SS --use-mmap
If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by \f[V]--buffer-size\f[R]).
Memory allocated like this does not go on the Go heap and can be
returned to the OS immediately when it is finished with.
If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory pages
are returned less aggressively to the OS.
It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.
.SS --use-server-modtime
Some object-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file
modification times (modtime).
On these backends, rclone stores the original modtime as additional
metadata on the object.
By default it will make an API call to retrieve the metadata when the
modtime is needed by an operation.
Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the
server\[aq]s modified time.
In cases such as a local to remote sync using \f[V]--update\f[R],
knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last uploaded to
the remote is sufficient.
In those cases, this flag can speed up the process and reduce the number
of API calls necessary.
Using this flag on a sync operation without also using
\f[V]--update\f[R] would cause all files modified at any time other than
the last upload time to be uploaded again, which is probably not what
you want.
.SS -v, -vv, --verbose
With \f[V]-v\f[R] rclone will tell you about each file that is
transferred and a small number of significant events.
With \f[V]-vv\f[R] rclone will become very verbose telling you about
every file it considers and transfers.
Please send bug reports with a log with this setting.
When setting verbosity as an environment variable, use
\f[V]RCLONE_VERBOSE=1\f[R] or \f[V]RCLONE_VERBOSE=2\f[R] for
\f[V]-v\f[R] and \f[V]-vv\f[R] respectively.
.SS -V, --version
Prints the version number
.SS SSL/TLS options
The outgoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options.
For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or WebDAV backends.
Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of configuration for SSL/TLS
which you can find in their documentation.
.SS --ca-cert stringArray
This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificates and uses
it to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.
If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you will
need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.
.SS --client-cert string
This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.
This is used for mutual TLS
authentication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication).
The \f[V]--client-key\f[R] flag is required too when using this.
.SS --client-key string
This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication.
Used in conjunction with \f[V]--client-cert\f[R].
Supported types are:
Unencrypted PKCS#1 (\[dq]BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY\[dq])
Unencrypted PKCS#8 (\[dq]BEGIN PRIVATE KEY\[dq])
Encrypted PKCS#8 (\[dq]BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY\[dq])
Legacy PEM encryption (e.g., DEK-Info headers), which are automatically
detected.
.SS --client-pass string
This can be used to supply an optional password to decrypt the client
key file.
\f[B]NB\f[R] the password should be obscured so it should be the output
of \f[V]rclone obscure YOURPASSWORD\f[R].
.SS --no-check-certificate
\f[V]--no-check-certificate\f[R] controls whether a client verifies the
server\[aq]s certificate chain and host name.
If \f[V]--no-check-certificate\f[R] is true, TLS accepts any certificate
presented by the server and any host name in that certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
This option defaults to \f[V]false\f[R].
\f[B]This should be used only for testing.\f[R]
.SS Configuration encryption
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services.
This means that you should keep your \f[V]rclone.conf\f[R] file in a
secure location.
If you are in an environment where that isn\[aq]t possible, you can add
a password to your configuration.
This means that you will have to supply the password every time you
start rclone.
To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute
\f[V]rclone config\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone config
Current remotes:

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/s/q>
\f[R]
.fi
Go into \f[V]s\f[R], Set configuration password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
e/n/d/s/q> s
Your configuration is not encrypted.
If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
a) Add Password
q) Quit to main menu
a/q> a
Enter NEW configuration password:
password:
Confirm NEW password:
password:
Password set
Your configuration is encrypted.
c) Change Password
u) Unencrypt configuration
q) Quit to main menu
c/u/q>
\f[R]
.fi
Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will have to supply the password.
See below for details.
In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.
There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.
You can also use
rclone config encryption
set (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_set/) to set
the config encryption directly
rclone config encryption
remove (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_remove/) to
remove it
rclone config encryption
check (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_encryption_check/) to
check that it is encrypted properly.
rclone uses nacl
secretbox (https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which
in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate your
configuration with secret-key cryptography.
The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.
While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.
If it is safe in your environment, you can set the
\f[V]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] environment variable to contain your
password, in which case it will be used for decrypting the
configuration.
You can set this for a session from a script.
For unix like systems save this to a file called
\f[V]set-rclone-password\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#!/bin/echo Source this file don\[aq]t run it

read -s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
\f[R]
.fi
Then source the file when you want to use it.
From the shell you would do \f[V]source set-rclone-password\f[R].
It will then ask you for the password and set it in the environment
variable.
An alternate means of supplying the password is to provide a script
which will retrieve the password and print on standard output.
This script should have a fully specified path name and not rely on any
environment variables.
The script is supplied either via
\f[V]--password-command=\[dq]...\[dq]\f[R] command line argument or via
the \f[V]RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND\f[R] environment variable.
One useful example of this is using the \f[V]passwordstore\f[R]
application to retrieve the password:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND=\[dq]pass rclone/config\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
If the \f[V]passwordstore\f[R] password manager holds the password for
the rclone configuration, using the script method means the password is
primarily protected by the \f[V]passwordstore\f[R] system, and is never
embedded in the clear in scripts, nor available for examination using
the standard commands available.
It is quite possible with long running rclone sessions for copies of
passwords to be innocently captured in log files or terminal scroll
buffers, etc.
Using the script method of supplying the password enhances the security
of the config password considerably.
If you are running rclone inside a script, unless you are using the
\f[V]--password-command\f[R] method, you might want to disable password
prompts.
To do that, pass the parameter \f[V]--ask-password=false\f[R] to rclone.
This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if
\f[V]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] doesn\[aq]t contain a valid password, and
\f[V]--password-command\f[R] has not been supplied.
Whenever running commands that may be affected by options in a
configuration file, rclone will look for an existing file according to
the rules described above, and load any it finds.
If an encrypted file is found, this includes decrypting it, with the
possible consequence of a password prompt.
When executing a command line that you know are not actually using
anything from such a configuration file, you can avoid it being loaded
by overriding the location, e.g.
with one of the documented special values for memory-only configuration.
Since only backend options can be stored in configuration files, this is
normally unnecessary for commands that do not operate on backends, e.g.
\f[V]completion\f[R].
However, it will be relevant for commands that do operate on backends in
general, but are used without referencing a stored remote, e.g.
listing local filesystem paths, or connection strings:
\f[V]rclone --config=\[dq]\[dq] ls .\f[R]

.SS --memprofile string
Write memory profile to a file.
This can be analysed with \f[V]go tool pprof\f[R].
.SS --dump DumpFlags
The \f[V]--dump\f[R] flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump
info about.
Note that some headers, such as \f[V]Accept-Encoding\f[R], may not be
correct as shown in the request, and the response may not show
\f[V]Content-Encoding\f[R] if the go standard libraries auto gzip
encoding was in effect.
In this case the body of the request will be gunzipped before showing
it.
The available flags are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]headers\f[R] dumps HTTP headers.
Any \f[V]Authorization:\f[R] headers will be excluded, but output may
still contain sensitive information.

It uses the \f[V]lsof\f[R] Unix command to do that, so you\[aq]ll need
that installed to use it.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]mapper\f[R] dumps the JSON blobs being sent to the program supplied
with \f[V]--metadata-mapper\f[R] and received from it.
It can be useful for debugging the metadata mapper interface.

.IP \[bu] 2
Anything starting with \f[V]--rc-\f[R]
See the remote control section (https://rclone.org/rc/).
.SS Logging
rclone has 4 levels of logging, \f[V]ERROR\f[R], \f[V]NOTICE\f[R],
\f[V]INFO\f[R] and \f[V]DEBUG\f[R].
By default, rclone logs to standard error.
This means you can redirect standard error and still see the normal
output of rclone commands (e.g.
\f[V]rclone ls\f[R]).
By default, rclone will produce \f[V]Error\f[R] and \f[V]Notice\f[R]
level messages.
If you use the \f[V]-q\f[R] flag, rclone will only produce
\f[V]Error\f[R] messages.
If you use the \f[V]-v\f[R] flag, rclone will produce \f[V]Error\f[R],
\f[V]Notice\f[R] and \f[V]Info\f[R] messages.
If you use the \f[V]-vv\f[R] flag, rclone will produce \f[V]Error\f[R],
\f[V]Notice\f[R], \f[V]Info\f[R] and \f[V]Debug\f[R] messages.
You can also control the log levels with the \f[V]--log-level\f[R] flag.
If you use the \f[V]--log-file\f[R] option, rclone will redirect
\f[V]Error\f[R], \f[V]Info\f[R] and \f[V]Debug\f[R] messages along with
standard error to a file.
If you use the \f[V]--syslog\f[R] flag then rclone will log to syslog
and the \f[V]--syslog-facility\f[R] control which facility it uses.
Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, e.g.
INFO which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.
.SS Metrics
Rclone can publish metrics in the OpenMetrics/Prometheus format.
To enable the metrics endpoint, use the \f[V]--metrics-addr\f[R] flag.
Metrics can also be published on the \f[V]--rc-addr\f[R] port if the
\f[V]--rc\f[R] flag and \f[V]--rc-enable-metrics\f[R] flags are supplied
or if using rclone rcd \f[V]--rc-enable-metrics\f[R]
Rclone provides extensive configuration options for the metrics HTTP
endpoint.
These settings are grouped under the Metrics section and have a prefix
\f[V]--metrics-*\f[R].
When metrics are enabled with \f[V]--rc-enable-metrics\f[R], they will
be published on the same port as the rc API.
In this case, the \f[V]--metrics-*\f[R] flags will be ignored, and the
HTTP endpoint configuration will be managed by the \f[V]--rc-*\f[R]
parameters.
.SS Exit code
If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with
a non-zero exit code.
This allows scripts to detect when rclone operations have failed.
During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration.
There will always be a log message immediately before exiting.
When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still
failed transfers.
For every error counted there will be a high priority log message
(visible with \f[V]-q\f[R]) showing the message and which file caused
the problem.
A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry so the user
can see that any previous error messages may not be valid after the
retry.
If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority message if the
retry was successful.
.SS List of exit codes

\f[V]0\f[R] - Success

\f[V]--error-on-no-transfer\f[R])
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]10\f[R] - Duration exceeded - limit set by --max-duration reached
.SS Environment variables
Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.
These can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.
.SS Options
Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.
To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading \f[V]--\f[R], change \f[V]-\f[R] to
\f[V]_\f[R], make upper case and prepend \f[V]RCLONE_\f[R].
For example, to always set \f[V]--stats 5s\f[R], set the environment
variable \f[V]RCLONE_STATS=5s\f[R].
If you set stats on the command line this will override the environment
variable setting.
Or to always use the trash in drive \f[V]--drive-use-trash\f[R], set
\f[V]RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true\f[R].
Verbosity is slightly different, the environment variable equivalent of
\f[V]--verbose\f[R] or \f[V]-v\f[R] is \f[V]RCLONE_VERBOSE=1\f[R], or
for \f[V]-vv\f[R], \f[V]RCLONE_VERBOSE=2\f[R].
The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so
they take exactly the same form.
The options set by environment variables can be seen with the
\f[V]-vv\f[R] flag, e.g.
\f[V]rclone version -vv\f[R].
Options that can appear multiple times (type \f[V]stringArray\f[R]) are
treated slightly differently as environment variables can only be
defined once.
In order to allow a simple mechanism for adding one or many items, the
input is treated as a CSV encoded (https://godoc.org/encoding/csv)
string.
For example
.TS
tab(@);
lw(36.7n) lw(33.3n).
T{
Environment variable
T}@T{
Equivalent options
T}
_
T{
\f[V]RCLONE_EXCLUDE=\[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R]
T}@T{
\f[V]--exclude \[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R]
T}
T{
\f[V]RCLONE_EXCLUDE=\[dq]*.jpg,*.png\[dq]\f[R]
T}@T{
\f[V]--exclude \[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R] \f[V]--exclude \[dq]*.png\[dq]\f[R]
T}
T{
\f[V]RCLONE_EXCLUDE=\[aq]\[dq]*.jpg\[dq],\[dq]*.png\[dq]\[aq]\f[R]
T}@T{
\f[V]--exclude \[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R] \f[V]--exclude \[dq]*.png\[dq]\f[R]
T}
T{
\f[V]RCLONE_EXCLUDE=\[aq]\[dq]/directory with comma , in it /**\[dq]\[aq]\f[R]
T}@T{
\[ga]--exclude \[dq]/directory with comma , in it /**\[dq]
T}
.TE
If \f[V]stringArray\f[R] options are defined as environment variables
\f[B]and\f[R] options on the command line then all the values will be
used.
.SS Config file
You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis.
The names of the config items are documented in the page for each
backend.
To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
\f[V]RCLONE_CONFIG_\f[R] + name of remote + \f[V]_\f[R] + name of config
file option and make it all uppercase.
Note one implication here is the remote\[aq]s name must be convertible
into a valid environment variable name, so it can only contain letters,
digits, or the \f[V]_\f[R] (underscore) character.
For example, to configure an S3 remote named \f[V]mys3:\f[R] without a
config file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
mys3:
Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you
must create the \f[V]..._TYPE\f[R] variable as above.
Note that the name of a remote created using environment variable is
case insensitive, in contrast to regular remotes stored in config file
as documented above.
You must write the name in uppercase in the environment variable, but as
seen from example above it will be listed and can be accessed in
lowercase, while you can also refer to the same remote in uppercase:
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone lsd MYS3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
Note that you can only set the options of the immediate backend, so
RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3CRYPT_ACCESS_KEY_ID has no effect, if myS3Crypt is a
crypt remote based on an S3 remote.
However RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID will set the access key of all remotes
using S3, including myS3Crypt.
Note also that now rclone has connection strings, it is probably easier
to use those instead which makes the above example
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone lsd :s3,access_key_id=XXX,secret_access_key=XXX:
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Precedence
The various different methods of backend configuration are read in this
order and the first one with a value is used.
Parameters in connection strings, e.g.
\f[V]myRemote,skip_links:\f[R]
Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g.
\f[V]--skip-links\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Remote specific environment vars, e.g.
\f[V]RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_SKIP_LINKS\f[R] (see above).
.IP \[bu] 2
Backend-specific environment vars, e.g.
\f[V]RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Backend generic environment vars, e.g.
\f[V]RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Config file, e.g.
\f[V]skip_links = true\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Default values, e.g.
\f[V]false\f[R] - these can\[aq]t be changed.
So if both \f[V]--skip-links\f[R] is supplied on the command line and an
environment variable \f[V]RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS\f[R] is set, the
command line flag will take preference.
The backend configurations set by environment variables can be seen with
the \f[V]-vv\f[R] flag, e.g.
\f[V]rclone about myRemote: -vv\f[R].
For non backend configuration the order is as follows:
.IP \[bu] 2
Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g.
\f[V]--stats 5s\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Environment vars, e.g.
\f[V]RCLONE_STATS=5s\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Default values, e.g.
\f[V]1m\f[R] - these can\[aq]t be changed.
.SS Other environment variables
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS\f[R] set to contain your config file password
(see Configuration Encryption section)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]HTTP_PROXY\f[R], \f[V]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R] and \f[V]NO_PROXY\f[R] (or
the lowercase versions thereof).
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]HTTPS_PROXY\f[R] takes precedence over \f[V]HTTP_PROXY\f[R] for
https requests.
.IP \[bu] 2
The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
\[dq]host[:port]\[dq] for, in which case the \[dq]http\[dq] scheme is
assumed.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]USER\f[R] and \f[V]LOGNAME\f[R] values are used as fallbacks for
current username.
The primary method for looking up username is OS-specific: Windows API
on Windows, real user ID in /etc/passwd on Unix systems.
In the documentation the current username is simply referred to as
\f[V]$USER\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR\f[R] - rclone \f[B]sets\f[R] this variable for
use in config files and sub processes to point to the directory holding
the config file.
The options set by environment variables can be seen with the
\f[V]-vv\f[R] and \f[V]--log-level=DEBUG\f[R] flags, e.g.
\f[V]rclone version -vv\f[R].
.SH Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine
Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an
internet-connected web browser.
If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless machine with
no browser available on it (e.g.
a NAS or a server in a datacenter), then you will need to use an
alternative means of configuration.
There are three ways of doing it, described below.
.SS Configuring using rclone authorize
On the headless machine run rclone config, but answer \f[V]N\f[R] to the
question
\f[V]Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.

y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> n

Option config_token.
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
a web browser available.
For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/
Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
version recommended):
        rclone authorize \[dq]onedrive\[dq]
Then paste the result.
Enter a value.
config_token>
\f[R]
.fi
Then on your main desktop machine, run rclone
authorize (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_authorize/).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone authorize \[dq]onedrive\[dq]
NOTICE: Make sure your Redirect URL is set to \[dq]http://localhost:53682/\[dq] in your custom config.
NOTICE: If your browser doesn\[aq]t open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTICE: Log in and authorize rclone for access
NOTICE: Waiting for code...

<---End paste
\f[R]
.fi
Then back to the headless machine, paste in the code.
.IP

--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Configuring by copying the config file
Rclone stores all of its configuration in a single file.
This can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone (although some
backends does not support reusing the same configuration, consult your
backend documentation to be sure).
Start by running rclone config to create the configuration file on your
desktop machine.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone config
\f[R]
.fi
Then locate the file by running rclone config file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf
\f[R]
.fi
Finally, transfer the file to the remote machine (scp, cut paste, ftp,
sftp, etc.)
and place it in the correct location (use rclone config file on the
remote machine to find out where).
.SS Configuring using SSH Tunnel
If you have an SSH client installed on your local machine, you can set
up an SSH tunnel to redirect the port 53682 into the headless machine by
using the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
ssh -L localhost:53682:localhost:53682 username\[at]remote_server
\f[R]
.fi
Then on the headless machine run rclone config and answer \f[V]Y\f[R] to
the question
\f[V]Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.

y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> y
NOTICE: Make sure your Redirect URL is set to \[dq]http://localhost:53682/\[dq] in your custom config.
NOTICE: If your browser doesn\[aq]t open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTICE: Log in and authorize rclone for access
NOTICE: Waiting for code...
\f[R]
.fi
Finally, copy and paste the presented URL
\f[V]http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\f[R] to
the browser on your local machine, complete the auth and you are done.
.SH Filtering, includes and excludes
Filter flags determine which files rclone \f[V]sync\f[R],
\f[V]move\f[R], \f[V]ls\f[R], \f[V]lsl\f[R], \f[V]md5sum\f[R],
\f[V]sha1sum\f[R], \f[V]size\f[R], \f[V]delete\f[R], \f[V]check\f[R] and
similar commands apply to.
They are specified in terms of path/file name patterns; path/file lists;
file age and size, or presence of a file in a directory.
Bucket based remotes without the concept of directory apply filters to
object key, age and size in an analogous way.
Rclone \f[V]purge\f[R] does not obey filters.
To test filters without risk of damage to data, apply them to
\f[V]rclone ls\f[R], or with the \f[V]--dry-run\f[R] and \f[V]-vv\f[R]
flags.
Rclone filter patterns can only be used in filter command line options,
not in the specification of a remote.
E.g.
\f[V]rclone copy \[dq]remote:dir*.jpg\[dq] /path/to/dir\f[R] does not
have a filter effect.
\f[V]rclone copy remote:dir /path/to/dir --include \[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R]
does.
\f[B]Important\f[R] Avoid mixing any two of \f[V]--include...\f[R],
\f[V]--exclude...\f[R] or \f[V]--filter...\f[R] flags in an rclone
command.
The results might not be what you expect.
Instead use a \f[V]--filter...\f[R] flag.
.SS Patterns for matching path/file names
.SS Pattern syntax
Here is a formal definition of the pattern syntax, examples are below.
Rclone matching rules follow a glob style:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
*         matches any sequence of non-separator (/) characters
**        matches any sequence of characters including / separators
?         matches any single non-separator (/) character
[ [ ! ] { character-range } ]
          character class (must be non-empty)
{ pattern-list }
          pattern alternatives
{{ regexp }}
          regular expression to match
c         matches character c (c != *, **, ?, \[rs], [, {, })
\[rs]c        matches reserved character c (c = *, **, ?, \[rs], [, {, }) or character class
\f[R]
.fi
character-range:
c         matches character c (c != \[rs], -, ])
\[rs]c        matches reserved character c (c = \[rs], -, ])
lo - hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi
pattern-list:
pattern { , pattern }
          comma-separated (without spaces) patterns
character classes (see Go regular expression
reference (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)) include:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Named character classes (e.g. [\[rs]d], [\[ha]\[rs]d], [\[rs]D], [\[ha]\[rs]D])
Perl character classes (e.g. \[rs]s, \[rs]S, \[rs]w, \[rs]W)
ASCII character classes (e.g. [[:alnum:]], [[:alpha:]], [[:punct:]], [[:xdigit:]])
\f[R]
.fi
regexp for advanced users to insert a regular expression - see below for
more info:
Any re2 regular expression not containing \[ga]}}\[ga]
If the filter pattern starts with a \f[V]/\f[R] then it only matches at
the top level of the directory tree, \f[B]relative to the root of the
remote\f[R] (not necessarily the root of the drive).
If it does not start with \f[V]/\f[R] then it is matched starting at the
\f[B]end of the path/file name\f[R] but it only matches a complete path
element - it must match from a \f[V]/\f[R] separator or the beginning of
the path/file.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
file.jpg   - matches \[dq]file.jpg\[dq]
           - matches \[dq]directory/file.jpg\[dq]
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]afile.jpg\[dq]
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]directory/afile.jpg\[dq]
/file.jpg  - matches \[dq]file.jpg\[dq] in the root directory of the remote
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]afile.jpg\[dq]
           - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]directory/file.jpg\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
The top level of the remote might not be the top level of the drive.
E.g.
for a Microsoft Windows local directory structure
F:
├── bkp
├── data
│   ├── excl
│   │   ├── 123.jpg
│   │   └── 456.jpg
│   ├── incl
│   │   └── document.pdf
To copy the contents of folder \f[V]data\f[R] into folder \f[V]bkp\f[R]
excluding the contents of subfolder \f[V]excl\f[R]the following command
treats \f[V]F:\[rs]data\f[R] and \f[V]F:\[rs]bkp\f[R] as top level for
filtering.
\f[V]rclone copy F:\[rs]data\[rs] F:\[rs]bkp\[rs] --exclude=/excl/**\f[R]
\f[B]Important\f[R] Use \f[V]/\f[R] in path/file name patterns and not
\f[V]\[rs]\f[R] even if running on Microsoft Windows.
Simple patterns are case sensitive unless the \f[V]--ignore-case\f[R]
flag is used.
.PP
Without \f[V]--ignore-case\f[R] (default)
potato - matches \[dq]potato\[dq]
       - doesn\[aq]t match \[dq]POTATO\[dq]
.PP
With \f[V]--ignore-case\f[R]
potato - matches \[dq]potato\[dq]
       - matches \[dq]POTATO\[dq]
.SS Using regular expressions in filter patterns
.PP
The syntax of filter patterns is glob style matching (like
\f[V]bash\f[R] uses) to make things easy for users.
However this does not provide absolute control over the matching, so for
advanced users rclone also provides a regular expression syntax.
.PP
Rclone generally accepts Perl-style regular expressions, the exact
syntax is defined in the Go regular expression
reference (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).
Regular expressions should be enclosed in \f[V]{{\f[R] \f[V]}}\f[R].
They will match only the last path segment if the glob doesn\[aq]t start
with \f[V]/\f[R] or the whole path name if it does.
Note that rclone does not attempt to parse the supplied regular
expression, meaning that using any regular expression filter will
prevent rclone from using directory filter rules, as it will instead
check every path against the supplied regular expression(s).
.PP
Here is how the \f[V]{{regexp}}\f[R] is transformed into an full regular
expression to match the entire path:
{{regexp}}  becomes (\[ha]|/)(regexp)$
/{{regexp}} becomes \[ha](regexp)$
.PP
Regexp syntax can be mixed with glob syntax, for example
*.{{jpe?g}} to match file.jpg, file.jpeg but not file.png
.PP
You can also use regexp flags - to set case insensitive, for example
*.{{(?i)jpg}} to match file.jpg, file.JPG but not file.png
.PP
Be careful with wildcards in regular expressions - you don\[aq]t want
them to match path separators normally.
To match any file name starting with \f[V]start\f[R] and ending with
\f[V]end\f[R] write
{{start[\[ha]/]*end\[rs].jpg}}
Not
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{start.*end\[rs].jpg}}
\f[R]
.fi
Which will match a directory called \f[V]start\f[R] with a file called
\f[V]end.jpg\f[R] in it as the \f[V].*\f[R] will match \f[V]/\f[R]
characters.
Note that you can use \f[V]-vv --dump filters\f[R] to show the filter
patterns in regexp format - rclone implements the glob patterns by
transforming them into regular expressions.

.SS How filter rules are applied to files
Rclone path/file name filters are made up of one or more of the
following flags:
\f[V]--exclude\f[R]
\f[V]--exclude-from\f[R]
\f[V]--filter\f[R]
\f[V]--filter-from\f[R]
There can be more than one instance of individual flags.
Rclone internally uses a combined list of all the include and exclude
rules.
The order in which rules are processed can influence the result of the
filter.
All flags of the same type are processed together in the order above,
regardless of what order the different types of flags are included on
the command line.
Multiple instances of the same flag are processed from left to right
according to their position in the command line.
To mix up the order of processing includes and excludes use
\f[V]--filter...\f[R] flags.
Within \f[V]--include-from\f[R], \f[V]--exclude-from\f[R] and
\f[V]--filter-from\f[R] flags rules are processed from top to bottom of
the referenced file.
If there is an \f[V]--include\f[R] or \f[V]--include-from\f[R] flag
specified, rclone implies a \f[V]- **\f[R] rule which it adds to the
bottom of the internal rule list.
Specifying a \f[V]+\f[R] rule with a \f[V]--filter...\f[R] flag does not
imply that rule.
Each path/file name passed through rclone is matched against the
combined filter list.
At first match to a rule the path/file name is included or excluded and
no further filter rules are processed for that path/file.
If rclone does not find a match, after testing against all rules
(including the implied rule if appropriate), the path/file name is
included.
Any path/file included at that stage is processed by the rclone command.
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] and \f[V]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags over-ride
and cannot be combined with other filter options.
To see the internal combined rule list, in regular expression form, for
a command add the \f[V]--dump filters\f[R] flag.
Running an rclone command with \f[V]--dump filters\f[R] and
\f[V]-vv\f[R] flags lists the internal filter elements and shows how
they are applied to each source path/file.
There is not currently a means provided to pass regular expression
filter options into rclone directly though character class filter rules
contain character classes.
Go regular expression reference (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)
.SS How filter rules are applied to directories
Rclone commands are applied to path/file names not directories.
The entire contents of a directory can be matched to a filter by the
pattern \f[V]directory/*\f[R] or recursively by \f[V]directory/**\f[R].
Directory filter rules are defined with a closing \f[V]/\f[R] separator.
E.g.
\f[V]/directory/subdirectory/\f[R] is an rclone directory filter rule.
Rclone commands can use directory filter rules to determine whether they
recurse into subdirectories.
This potentially optimises access to a remote by avoiding listing
unnecessary directories.
Whether optimisation is desirable depends on the specific filter rules
and source remote content.
If any regular expression filters are in use, then no directory
recursion optimisation is possible, as rclone must check every path
against the supplied regular expression(s).
Directory recursion optimisation occurs if either:
A source remote does not support the rclone \f[V]ListR\f[R] primitive.
local, sftp, Microsoft OneDrive and WebDAV do not support
\f[V]ListR\f[R].
Google Drive and most bucket type storage do.
Full list (https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
On other remotes (those that support \f[V]ListR\f[R]), if the rclone
command is not naturally recursive, and provided it is not run with the
\f[V]--fast-list\f[R] flag.
\f[V]ls\f[R], \f[V]lsf -R\f[R] and \f[V]size\f[R] are naturally
recursive but \f[V]sync\f[R], \f[V]copy\f[R] and \f[V]move\f[R] are not.
Whenever the \f[V]--disable ListR\f[R] flag is applied to an rclone
command.
Rclone commands imply directory filter rules from path/file filter
rules.
To view the directory filter rules rclone has implied for a command
specify the \f[V]--dump filters\f[R] flag.
E.g.
for an include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/*.jpg
\f[R]
.fi
Rclone implies the directory include rule
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/a/
\f[R]
.fi
Directory filter rules specified in an rclone command can limit the
scope of an rclone command but path/file filters still have to be
specified.
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --include /directory/\f[R] will not match any
files.
Because it is an \f[V]--include\f[R] option the \f[V]--exclude **\f[R]
rule is implied, and the \f[V]/directory/\f[R] pattern serves only to
optimise access to the remote by ignoring everything outside of that
directory.
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-list.txt\f[R] with a file
\f[V]filter-list.txt\f[R]:
- /dir1/
- /dir2/
+ *.pdf
- **
All files in directories \f[V]dir1\f[R] or \f[V]dir2\f[R] or their
subdirectories are completely excluded from the listing.
Only files of suffix \f[V]pdf\f[R] in the root of \f[V]remote:\f[R] or
its subdirectories are listed.
The \f[V]- **\f[R] rule prevents listing of any path/files not
previously matched by the rules above.
Option \f[V]exclude-if-present\f[R] creates a directory exclude rule
based on the presence of a file in a directory and takes precedence over
other rclone directory filter rules.
.PP
When using pattern list syntax, if a pattern item contains either
\f[V]/\f[R] or \f[V]**\f[R], then rclone will not able to imply a
directory filter rule from this pattern list.
.PP
E.g.
for an include rule
{dir1/**,dir2/**}
Rclone will match files below directories \f[V]dir1\f[R] or
\f[V]dir2\f[R] only, but will not be able to use this filter to exclude
a directory \f[V]dir3\f[R] from being traversed.
Directory recursion optimisation may affect performance, but normally
not the result.
One exception to this is sync operations with option
\f[V]--create-empty-src-dirs\f[R], where any traversed empty directories
will be created.
With the pattern list example \f[V]{dir1/**,dir2/**}\f[R] above, this
would create an empty directory \f[V]dir3\f[R] on destination (when it
exists on source).
Changing the filter to \f[V]{dir1,dir2}/**\f[R], or splitting it into
two include rules \f[V]--include dir1/** --include dir2/**\f[R], will
match the same files while also filtering directories, with the result
that an empty directory \f[V]dir3\f[R] will no longer be created.
.SS \f[V]--exclude\f[R] - Exclude files matching pattern
.PP
Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on a single
exclude rule.
.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
\f[V]--exclude\f[R] should not be used with \f[V]--include\f[R],
\f[V]--include-from\f[R], \f[V]--filter\f[R] or \f[V]--filter-from\f[R]
flags.
.PP
\f[V]--exclude\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] or \f[V]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
.PP
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --exclude *.bak\f[R] excludes all .bak files from
listing.
.PP
E.g.
\f[V]rclone size remote: --exclude \[dq]/dir/**\[dq]\f[R] returns the
total size of all files on \f[V]remote:\f[R] excluding those in root
directory \f[V]dir\f[R] and sub directories.
.PP
E.g.
on Microsoft Windows
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --exclude \[dq]*\[rs][{JP,KR,HK}\[rs]]*\[dq]\f[R]
lists the files in \f[V]remote:\f[R] without \f[V][JP]\f[R] or
\f[V][KR]\f[R] or \f[V][HK]\f[R] in their name.
Quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the \f[V]\[rs]\f[R]
characters.\f[V]\[rs]\f[R] characters escape the \f[V][\f[R] and
\f[V]]\f[R] so an rclone filter treats them literally rather than as a
character-range.
The \f[V]{\f[R] and \f[V]}\f[R] define an rclone pattern list.
For other operating systems single quotes are required ie
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --exclude \[aq]*\[rs][{JP,KR,HK}\[rs]]*\[aq]\f[R]
.SS \f[V]--exclude-from\f[R] - Read exclude patterns from file
.PP
Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on rules in a
named file.
The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.
.PP
For an example \f[V]exclude-file.txt\f[R]:
# a sample exclude rule file
*.bak
file2.jpg
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --exclude-from exclude-file.txt\f[R] lists the
files on \f[V]remote:\f[R] except those named \f[V]file2.jpg\f[R] or
with a suffix \f[V].bak\f[R].
That is equivalent to
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --exclude file2.jpg --exclude \[dq]*.bak\[dq]\f[R].
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
The \f[V]--exclude-from\f[R] flag is useful where multiple exclude
filter rules are applied to an rclone command.
\f[V]--exclude-from\f[R] should not be used with \f[V]--include\f[R],
\f[V]--include-from\f[R], \f[V]--filter\f[R] or \f[V]--filter-from\f[R]
flags.
\f[V]--exclude-from\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] or \f[V]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
\f[V]--exclude-from\f[R] followed by \f[V]-\f[R] reads filter rules from
standard input.
.SS \f[V]--include\f[R] - Include files matching pattern
Adds a single include rule based on path/file names to an rclone
command.
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
\f[V]--include\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] or \f[V]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
.PP
\f[V]--include\f[R] implies \f[V]--exclude **\f[R] at the end of an
rclone internal filter list.
Therefore if you mix \f[V]--include\f[R] and \f[V]--include-from\f[R]
flags with \f[V]--exclude\f[R], \f[V]--exclude-from\f[R],
\f[V]--filter\f[R] or \f[V]--filter-from\f[R], you must use include
rules for all the files you want in the include statement.
For more flexibility use the \f[V]--filter-from\f[R] flag.
.PP
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --include \[dq]*.{png,jpg}\[dq]\f[R] lists the
files on \f[V]remote:\f[R] with suffix \f[V].png\f[R] and
\f[V].jpg\f[R].
All other files are excluded.
.PP
E.g.
multiple rclone copy commands can be combined with \f[V]--include\f[R]
and a pattern-list.
rclone copy /vol1/A remote:A
rclone copy /vol1/B remote:B
is equivalent to:
rclone copy /vol1 remote: --include \[dq]{A,B}/**\[dq]
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote:/wheat --include \[dq]??[\[ha][:punct:]]*\[dq]\f[R]
lists the files \f[V]remote:\f[R] directory \f[V]wheat\f[R] (and
subdirectories) whose third character is not punctuation.
This example uses an ASCII character
class (https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).
.SS \f[V]--include-from\f[R] - Read include patterns from file
.PP
Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a named
file.
The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.
.PP
For an example \f[V]include-file.txt\f[R]:
# a sample include rule file
*.jpg
file2.avi
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --include-from include-file.txt\f[R] lists the
files on \f[V]remote:\f[R] with name \f[V]file2.avi\f[R] or suffix
\f[V].jpg\f[R].
That is equivalent to
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --include file2.avi --include \[dq]*.jpg\[dq]\f[R].
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
The \f[V]--include-from\f[R] flag is useful where multiple include
filter rules are applied to an rclone command.
.PP
\f[V]--include-from\f[R] implies \f[V]--exclude **\f[R] at the end of an
rclone internal filter list.
Therefore if you mix \f[V]--include\f[R] and \f[V]--include-from\f[R]
flags with \f[V]--exclude\f[R], \f[V]--exclude-from\f[R],
\f[V]--filter\f[R] or \f[V]--filter-from\f[R], you must use include
rules for all the files you want in the include statement.
For more flexibility use the \f[V]--filter-from\f[R] flag.
.PP
\f[V]--include-from\f[R] has no effect when combined with
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] or \f[V]--files-from-raw\f[R] flags.
.PP
\f[V]--include-from\f[R] followed by \f[V]-\f[R] reads filter rules from
standard input.
.SS \f[V]--filter\f[R] - Add a file-filtering rule
.PP

.PP
This flag can be repeated.
See above for the order filter flags are processed in.
.PP
\f[V]--filter +\f[R] differs from \f[V]--include\f[R].
In the case of \f[V]--include\f[R] rclone implies an
\f[V]--exclude *\f[R] rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal
rule list.
\f[V]--filter...+\f[R] does not imply that rule.
.PP
\f[V]--filter\f[R] has no effect when combined with

Only file 42.doc is listed.
Prior rules are cleared by the \f[V]!\f[R].
.SS \f[V]--files-from\f[R] - Read list of source-file names
Adds path/files to an rclone command from a list in a named file.
Rclone processes the path/file names in the order of the list, and no
others.
Other filter flags (\f[V]--include\f[R], \f[V]--include-from\f[R],
\f[V]--exclude\f[R], \f[V]--exclude-from\f[R], \f[V]--filter\f[R] and
\f[V]--filter-from\f[R]) are ignored when \f[V]--files-from\f[R] is
used.
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] expects a list of files as its input.
Leading or trailing whitespace is stripped from the input lines.
Lines starting with \f[V]#\f[R] or \f[V];\f[R] are ignored.
\f[V]--files-from\f[R] followed by \f[V]-\f[R] reads the list of files
from standard input.
Rclone commands with a \f[V]--files-from\f[R] flag traverse the remote,
treating the names in \f[V]--files-from\f[R] as a set of filters.
If the \f[V]--no-traverse\f[R] and \f[V]--files-from\f[R] flags are used
together an rclone command does not traverse the remote.
Instead it addresses each path/file named in the file individually.
For each path/file name, that requires typically 1 API call.
This can be efficient for a short \f[V]--files-from\f[R] list and a
remote containing many files.
Rclone commands do not error if any names in the \f[V]--files-from\f[R]
file are missing from the source remote.
The \f[V]--files-from\f[R] flag can be repeated in a single rclone
command to read path/file names from more than one file.
The files are read from left to right along the command line.
Paths within the \f[V]--files-from\f[R] file are interpreted as starting
with the root specified in the rclone command.
Leading \f[V]/\f[R] separators are ignored.
See --files-from-raw if you need the input to be processed in a raw
manner.
E.g.
for a file \f[V]files-from.txt\f[R]:
# comment
file1.jpg
subdir/file2.jpg
\f[V]rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics\f[R]
copies the following, if they exist, and only those files.
/home/me/pics/file1.jpg        → remote:pics/file1.jpg
/home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg → remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg
E.g.
to copy the following files referenced by their absolute paths:
/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect
First find a common subdirectory - in this case \f[V]/home\f[R] and put
the remaining files in \f[V]files-from.txt\f[R] with or without leading
\f[V]/\f[R], e.g.
user1/42
user1/dir/ford
user2/prefect
Then copy these to a remote:
rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup
The three files are transferred as follows:
/home/user1/42       → remote:backup/user1/important
/home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/user1/dir/file
/home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/user2/stuff
Alternatively if \f[V]/\f[R] is chosen as root \f[V]files-from.txt\f[R]
will be:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect
\f[R]
.fi
The copy command will be:
rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup
Then there will be an extra \f[V]home\f[R] directory on the remote:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/home/user1/42       → remote:backup/home/user1/42
/home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/home/user1/dir/ford
/home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/home/user2/prefect
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \f[V]--files-from-raw\f[R] - Read list of source-file names without any processing
This flag is the same as \f[V]--files-from\f[R] except that input is
read in a raw manner.
Lines with leading / trailing whitespace, and lines starting with
\f[V];\f[R] or \f[V]#\f[R] are read without any processing.
rclone lsf (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/) has a compatible
format that can be used to export file lists from remotes for input to
\f[V]--files-from-raw\f[R].
.SS \f[V]--ignore-case\f[R] - make searches case insensitive
By default, rclone filter patterns are case sensitive.
The \f[V]--ignore-case\f[R] flag makes all of the filters patterns on
the command line case insensitive.
E.g.
\f[V]--include \[dq]zaphod.txt\[dq]\f[R] does not match a file
\f[V]Zaphod.txt\f[R].
With \f[V]--ignore-case\f[R] a match is made.
.SS Quoting shell metacharacters
Rclone commands with filter patterns containing shell metacharacters may
not as work as expected in your shell and may require quoting.
.PP
E.g.
linux, OSX (\f[V]*\f[R] metacharacter)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--include \[rs]*.jpg\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--include \[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--include=\[aq]*.jpg\[aq]\f[R]
.PP
Microsoft Windows expansion is done by the command, not shell, so
\f[V]--include *.jpg\f[R] does not require quoting.
.PP
If the rclone error
\f[V]Command .... needs .... arguments maximum: you provided .... non flag arguments:\f[R]
is encountered, the cause is commonly spaces within the name of a remote
or flag value.
The fix then is to quote values containing spaces.
.SS Other filters
.SS \f[V]--min-size\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file smaller than this
.PP
Controls the minimum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are \f[V]KiB\f[R] but abbreviations \f[V]B\f[R],
\f[V]K\f[R], \f[V]M\f[R], \f[V]G\f[R], \f[V]T\f[R] or \f[V]P\f[R] are
valid.
.PP
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --min-size 50k\f[R] lists files on
\f[V]remote:\f[R] of 50 KiB size or larger.
.PP
See the size option docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#size-options) for
more info.
.SS \f[V]--max-size\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file larger than this
.PP
Controls the maximum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are \f[V]KiB\f[R] but abbreviations \f[V]B\f[R],
\f[V]K\f[R], \f[V]M\f[R], \f[V]G\f[R], \f[V]T\f[R] or \f[V]P\f[R] are
valid.
.PP
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --max-size 1G\f[R] lists files on
\f[V]remote:\f[R] of 1 GiB size or smaller.
.PP
See the size option docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#size-options) for
more info.
.SS \f[V]--max-age\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file older than this
.PP
Controls the maximum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
.PP
\f[V]--max-age\f[R] applies only to files and not to directories.
.PP
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --max-age 2d\f[R] lists files on
\f[V]remote:\f[R] of 2 days old or less.
.PP
See the time option docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#time-options) for
valid formats.
.SS \f[V]--min-age\f[R] - Don\[aq]t transfer any file younger than this
.PP
Controls the minimum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
(see \f[V]--max-age\f[R] for valid formats)
.PP
\f[V]--min-age\f[R] applies only to files and not to directories.
.PP
E.g.
\f[V]rclone ls remote: --min-age 2d\f[R] lists files on
\f[V]remote:\f[R] of 2 days old or more.
.PP
See the time option docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#time-options) for
valid formats.
.SS \f[V]--hash-filter\f[R] - Deterministically select a subset of files
.PP
The \f[V]--hash-filter\f[R] flag enables selecting a deterministic
subset of files, useful for:
.IP "1." 3
Running large sync operations across multiple machines.
.IP "2." 3
Checking a subset of files for bitrot.
.IP "3." 3
Any other operations where a sample of files is required.
.SS Syntax
.PP
The flag takes two parameters expressed as a fraction:
--hash-filter K/N
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]N\f[R]: The total number of partitions (must be a positive
integer).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]K\f[R]: The specific partition to select (an integer from
\f[V]0\f[R] to \f[V]N\f[R]).
For example:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--hash-filter 1/3\f[R]: Selects the first third of the files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--hash-filter 2/3\f[R] and \f[V]--hash-filter 3/3\f[R]: Select the
second and third partitions, respectively.
.PP
Each partition is non-overlapping, ensuring all files are covered
without duplication.
.SS Random Partition Selection
.PP
Use \f[V]\[at]\f[R] as \f[V]K\f[R] to randomly select a partition:
--hash-filter \[at]/M
For example, \f[V]--hash-filter \[at]/3\f[R] will randomly select a
number between 0 and 2.
This will stay constant across retries.
.SS How It Works
.IP \[bu] 2
Rclone takes each file\[aq]s full path, normalizes it to lowercase, and
applies Unicode normalization.
.IP \[bu] 2
It then hashes the normalized path into a 64 bit number.
.IP \[bu] 2
The hash result is reduced modulo \f[V]N\f[R] to assign the file to a
partition.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the calculated partition does not match \f[V]K\f[R] the file is
excluded.
.IP \[bu] 2
Other filters may apply if the file is not excluded.
\f[B]Important:\f[R] Rclone will traverse all directories to apply the
filter.
.SS Usage Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
Safe to use with \f[V]rclone sync\f[R]; source and destination
selections will match.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Do not\f[R] use with \f[V]--delete-excluded\f[R], as this could
delete unselected files.
.IP \[bu] 2
Ignored if \f[V]--files-from\f[R] is used.
.SS Examples
.SS Dividing files into 4 partitions
Assuming the current directory contains \f[V]file1.jpg\f[R] through
\f[V]file9.jpg\f[R]:
$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 0/4 .
file1.jpg
file5.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 1/4 .
file3.jpg
file6.jpg
file9.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 2/4 .
file2.jpg
file4.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 3/4 .

file8.jpg

$ rclone lsf --hash-filter 4/4 . # the same as --hash-filter 0/4

.SS Syncing the first quarter of files
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone sync --hash-filter 1/4 source:path destination:path
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Checking a random 1% of files for integrity
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone check --download --hash-filter \[at]/100 source:path destination:path
.SS Other flags
.SS \f[V]--delete-excluded\f[R] - Delete files on dest excluded from sync
\f[B]Important\f[R] this flag is dangerous to your data - use with
\f[V]--dry-run\f[R] and \f[V]-v\f[R] first.
.PP
In conjunction with \f[V]rclone sync\f[R], \f[V]--delete-excluded\f[R]
deletes any files on the destination which are excluded from the
command.
.PP
E.g.
the scope of \f[V]rclone sync --interactive A: B:\f[R] can be
restricted:
rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:
All files on \f[V]B:\f[R] which are less than 50 KiB are deleted because
they are excluded from the rclone sync command.
.SS \f[V]--dump filters\f[R] - dump the filters to the output
.PP
Dumps the defined filters to standard output in regular expression
format.
.PP
Useful for debugging.
.SS Exclude directory based on a file
.PP
The \f[V]--exclude-if-present\f[R] flag controls whether a directory is
within the scope of an rclone command based on the presence of a named
file within it.
The flag can be repeated to check for multiple file names, presence of
any of them will exclude the directory.
.PP
This flag has a priority over other filter flags.
.PP
E.g.
for the following directory structure:
dir1/file1
dir1/dir2/file2
dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore
The command \f[V]rclone ls --exclude-if-present .ignore dir1\f[R] does
not list \f[V]dir3\f[R], \f[V]file3\f[R] or \f[V].ignore\f[R].
.SS Metadata filters
.PP
The metadata filters work in a very similar way to the normal file name
filters, except they match metadata (https://rclone.org/docs/#metadata)
on the object.
.PP
The metadata should be specified as \f[V]key=value\f[R] patterns.
This may be wildcarded using the normal filter patterns or regular
expressions.
.PP
For example if you wished to list only local files with a mode of
\f[V]100664\f[R] you could do that with:
rclone lsf -M --files-only --metadata-include \[dq]mode=100664\[dq] .
Or if you wished to show files with an \f[V]atime\f[R], \f[V]mtime\f[R]
or \f[V]btime\f[R] at a given date:
rclone lsf -M --files-only --metadata-include \[dq][abm]time=2022-12-16*\[dq] .
Like file filtering, metadata filtering only applies to files not to
directories.
The filters can be applied using these flags.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--metadata-include\f[R] - Include metadatas matching pattern
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--metadata-include-from\f[R] - Read metadata include patterns from
file (use - to read from stdin)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--metadata-exclude\f[R] - Exclude metadatas matching pattern
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--metadata-exclude-from\f[R] - Read metadata exclude patterns from
file (use - to read from stdin)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--metadata-filter\f[R] - Add a metadata filtering rule
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--metadata-filter-from\f[R] - Read metadata filtering patterns from
a file (use - to read from stdin)
Each flag can be repeated.
See the section on how filter rules are applied for more details - these
flags work in an identical way to the file name filtering flags, but
instead of file name patterns have metadata patterns.
.SS Common pitfalls
The most frequent filter support issues on the rclone
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/) are:
Not using paths relative to the root of the remote
Not using \f[V]/\f[R] to match from the root of a remote
Not using \f[V]**\f[R] to match the contents of a directory
.SH GUI (Experimental)
Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface).
This is somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to
change.
Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then display
the GUI in a web browser.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rcd --rc-web-gui
\f[R]
.fi
This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to
serve the GUI:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: A new release for gui is present at https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/download/v0.0.6/currentbuild.zip

\f[R]
.fi
This assumes you are running rclone locally on your machine.
It is possible to separate the rclone and the GUI - see below for
details.
If you wish to check for updates then you can add
\f[V]--rc-web-gui-update\f[R] to the command line.
If you find your GUI broken, you may force it to update by add
\f[V]--rc-web-gui-force-update\f[R].
By default, rclone will open your browser.
Add \f[V]--rc-web-gui-no-open-browser\f[R] to disable this feature.
.SS Using the GUI
Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an
overall overview.
On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can
click on:
.IP \[bu] 2
Dashboard - main overview
.IP \[bu] 2
Configs - examine and create new configurations
.IP \[bu] 2
Explorer - view, download and upload files to the cloud storage systems
.IP \[bu] 2
Backend - view or alter the backend config
.IP \[bu] 2
Log out
(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)
.SS How it works
When you run the \f[V]rclone rcd --rc-web-gui\f[R] this is what happens
.IP \[bu] 2
Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API (\[dq]rc\[dq]).
.IP \[bu] 2
The API is bound to localhost with an auto-generated username and
password.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the same
port as the API
.IP \[bu] 2
rclone will open the browser with a \f[V]login_token\f[R] so it can log
straight in.
.SS Advanced use
The \f[V]rclone rcd\f[R] may use any of the flags documented on the rc
page (https://rclone.org/rc/#supported-parameters).
The flag \f[V]--rc-web-gui\f[R] is shorthand for
.IP \[bu] 2
Download the web GUI if necessary
.IP \[bu] 2
Check we are using some authentication
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-user gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-pass <random password>\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-serve\f[R]
These flags can be overridden as desired.
See also the rclone rcd
documentation (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).
.SS Example: Running a public GUI
For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an
htpasswd file using the following flags:
\f[V]--rc-web-gui\f[R]
\f[V]--rc-addr :443\f[R]
\f[V]--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-cert /path/to/ssl.crt\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-key /path/to/ssl.key\f[R]
.SS Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy
If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at \f[V]/rclone\f[R] you could
use these flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-web-gui\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-baseurl rclone\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd\f[R]
Or instead of htpasswd if you just want a single user and password:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-user me\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--rc-pass mypassword\f[R]
.SS Project
The GUI is being developed in the: rclone/rclone-webui-react
repository (https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react).
Bug reports and contributions are very welcome :-)
If you have questions then please ask them on the rclone
forum (https://forum.rclone.org/).
.SH Remote controlling rclone with its API
If rclone is run with the \f[V]--rc\f[R] flag then it starts an HTTP
server which can be used to remote control rclone using its API.
You can either use the rc command to access the API or use HTTP
directly.
If you just want to run a remote control then see the
rcd (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/) command.
.SS Supported parameters
.SS --rc
Flag to start the http server listen on remote requests.
.SS --rc-addr=IP
IPaddress:Port or :Port to bind server to.
(default \[dq]localhost:5572\[dq]).
.SS --rc-cert=KEY
SSL PEM key (concatenation of certificate and CA certificate).
.SS --rc-client-ca=PATH
Client certificate authority to verify clients with.
.SS --rc-htpasswd=PATH
htpasswd file - if not provided no authentication is done.
.SS --rc-key=PATH
TLS PEM private key file.
.SS --rc-max-header-bytes=VALUE
Maximum size of request header (default 4096).
.SS --rc-min-tls-version=VALUE
The minimum TLS version that is acceptable.
Valid values are \[dq]tls1.0\[dq], \[dq]tls1.1\[dq], \[dq]tls1.2\[dq]
and \[dq]tls1.3\[dq] (default \[dq]tls1.0\[dq]).
.SS --rc-user=VALUE
User name for authentication.
.SS --rc-pass=VALUE
Password for authentication.
.SS --rc-realm=VALUE
Realm for authentication (default \[dq]rclone\[dq]).
.SS --rc-server-read-timeout=DURATION
Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s).
.SS --rc-server-write-timeout=DURATION
Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s).
.SS --rc-serve
Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface.
This means objects will be accessible at
\f[V]http://127.0.0.1:5572/\f[R] by default, so you can browse to
\f[V]http://127.0.0.1:5572/\f[R] or \f[V]http://127.0.0.1:5572/*\f[R] to
see a listing of the remotes.
Objects may be requested from remotes using this syntax
\f[V]http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object\f[R]
Default Off.
.SS --rc-serve-no-modtime
Set this flag to skip reading the modification time (can speed things
up).
Default Off.
.SS --rc-files /path/to/directory
Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.
If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory.
It will also open the root in the web browser if specified.
This is for implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.
If \f[V]--rc-user\f[R] or \f[V]--rc-pass\f[R] is set then the URL that
is opened will have the authorization in the URL in the
\f[V]http://user:pass\[at]localhost/\f[R] style.
Default Off.
.SS --rc-enable-metrics
Enable OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible endpoint at \f[V]/metrics\f[R].
If more control over the metrics is desired (for example running it on a
different port or with different auth) then endpoint can be enabled with
the \f[V]--metrics-*\f[R] flags instead.
Default Off.
.SS --rc-web-gui
Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.
Default Off.
.SS --rc-allow-origin
Set the allowed Access-Control-Allow-Origin for rc requests.
Can be used with --rc-web-gui if the rclone is running on different IP
than the web-gui.
Default is IP address on which rc is running.
.SS --rc-web-fetch-url
Set the URL to fetch the rclone-web-gui files from.
Default
<https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/latest>.
.SS --rc-web-gui-update
Set this flag to check and update rclone-webui-react from the
rc-web-fetch-url.
Default Off.
.SS --rc-web-gui-force-update
Set this flag to force update rclone-webui-react from the
rc-web-fetch-url.
Default Off.
.SS --rc-web-gui-no-open-browser
Set this flag to disable opening browser automatically when using
web-gui.
Default Off.
.SS --rc-job-expire-duration=DURATION
Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).
.SS --rc-job-expire-interval=DURATION
Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).
.SS --rc-no-auth
By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on the
rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes.
Eg \f[V]operations/list\f[R] is denied as it involved creating a remote
as is \f[V]sync/copy\f[R].
If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods.
The alternative is to use \f[V]--rc-user\f[R] and \f[V]--rc-pass\f[R]
and use these credentials in the request.
Default Off.
.SS --rc-baseurl
Prefix for URLs.
Default is root
.SS --rc-template
User-specified template.
.SS Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command
Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its
\f[V]rclone rc\f[R] command.
You can use it like this:
$ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
{
    \[dq]param1\[dq]: \[dq]one\[dq],
    \[dq]param2\[dq]: \[dq]two\[dq]
}
If the remote is running on a different URL than the default
\f[V]http://localhost:5572/\f[R], use the \f[V]--url\f[R] option to
specify it:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc --url http://some.remote:1234/ rc/noop
\f[R]
.fi
Or, if the remote is listening on a Unix socket, use the
\f[V]--unix-socket\f[R] option instead:
rclone rc --unix-socket /tmp/rclone.sock rc/noop
Run \f[V]rclone rc\f[R] on its own, without any commands, to see the
help for the installed remote control commands.
Note that this also needs to connect to the remote server.
.SS JSON input
\f[V]rclone rc\f[R] also supports a \f[V]--json\f[R] flag which can be
used to send more complicated input parameters.
$ rclone rc --json \[aq]{ \[dq]p1\[dq]: [1,\[dq]2\[dq],null,4], \[dq]p2\[dq]: { \[dq]a\[dq]:1, \[dq]b\[dq]:2 } }\[aq] rc/noop
{
    \[dq]p1\[dq]: [
        1,
        \[dq]2\[dq],
        null,
        4
    ],
    \[dq]p2\[dq]: {
        \[dq]a\[dq]: 1,
        \[dq]b\[dq]: 2
    }
}
If the parameter being passed is an object then it can be passed as a
JSON string rather than using the \f[V]--json\f[R] flag which simplifies
the command line.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc operations/list fs=/tmp remote=test opt=\[aq]{\[dq]showHash\[dq]: true}\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
Rather than
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc operations/list --json \[aq]{\[dq]fs\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp\[dq], \[dq]remote\[dq]: \[dq]test\[dq], \[dq]opt\[dq]: {\[dq]showHash\[dq]: true}}\[aq]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Special parameters
The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to
\f[B]all\f[R] commands.

.SS Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true
Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id.
By default jobs are executed immediately as they are created or
synchronously.
If \f[V]_async\f[R] has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it
will return immediately with a job id and execute id, and the task will
be run in the background.
The \f[V]job/status\f[R] call can be used to get information of the
background job.
The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after it has finished.
It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, e.g.
\f[V]sync/sync\f[R], \f[V]sync/copy\f[R], \f[V]sync/move\f[R],
\f[V]operations/purge\f[R] are run with the \f[V]_async\f[R] flag to
avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and response timing
out.
Starting a job with the \f[V]_async\f[R] flag:

}
\f[R]
.fi
The \f[V]jobid\f[R] is a unique identifier for the job within this
rclone instance.
The \f[V]executeId\f[R] identifies the rclone process instance and
changes after rclone restart.
Together, the pair (\f[V]executeId\f[R], \f[V]jobid\f[R]) uniquely
identifies a job across rclone restarts.
Query the status to see if the job has finished.
For more information on the meaning of these return parameters see the
\f[V]job/status\f[R] call.

.SS Setting config flags with _config
.PP
If you wish to set config (the equivalent of the global flags) for the
duration of an rc call only then pass in the \f[V]_config\f[R]
parameter.
.PP
This should be in the same format as the \f[V]main\f[R] key returned by
options/get.
rclone rc --loopback options/get blocks=main
You can see more help on these options with this command (see the
options blocks section for more info).
rclone rc --loopback options/info blocks=main
For example, if you wished to run a sync with the \f[V]--checksum\f[R]
parameter, you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.
\[dq]_config\[dq]:{\[dq]CheckSum\[dq]: true}
If using \f[V]rclone rc\f[R] this could be passed as
rclone rc sync/sync ... _config=\[aq]{\[dq]CheckSum\[dq]: true}\[aq]
Any config parameters you don\[aq]t set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.
.PP
Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers - see
data types for more info.
Here is an example setting the equivalent of \f[V]--buffer-size\f[R] in
string or integer format.
\[dq]_config\[dq]:{\[dq]BufferSize\[dq]: \[dq]42M\[dq]}
\[dq]_config\[dq]:{\[dq]BufferSize\[dq]: 44040192}

.SS Assigning operations to groups with _group = value
Each rc call has its own stats group for tracking its metrics.
By default grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix
\f[V]job/\f[R] and id of the job like so \f[V]job/1\f[R].
If \f[V]_group\f[R] has a value then stats for that request will be
grouped under that value.
This allows caller to group stats under their own name.
Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing \f[V]group\f[R] to
\f[V]core/stats\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ rclone rc --json \[aq]{ \[dq]group\[dq]: \[dq]job/1\[dq] }\[aq] core/stats

.SS Data types
When the API returns types, these will mostly be straight forward
integer, string or boolean types.
However some of the types returned by the options/get call and taken by
the options/set calls as well as the \f[V]vfsOpt\f[R],
\f[V]mountOpt\f[R] and the \f[V]_config\f[R] parameters.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]Duration\f[R] - these are returned as an integer duration in
nanoseconds.
They may be set as an integer, or they may be set with time string, eg
\[dq]5s\[dq].
See the options section (https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for more
info.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]Size\f[R] - these are returned as an integer number of bytes.
They may be set as an integer or they may be set with a size suffix
string, eg \[dq]10M\[dq].
See the options section (https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for more
info.
.IP \[bu] 2
Enumerated type (such as \f[V]CutoffMode\f[R], \f[V]DumpFlags\f[R],
\f[V]LogLevel\f[R], \f[V]VfsCacheMode\f[R] - these will be returned as
an integer and may be set as an integer but more conveniently they can
be set as a string, eg \[dq]HARD\[dq] for \f[V]CutoffMode\f[R] or
\f[V]DEBUG\f[R] for \f[V]LogLevel\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]BandwidthSpec\f[R] - this will be set and returned as a string, eg
\[dq]1M\[dq].
.SS Option blocks
The calls options/info (for the main config) and config/providers (for
the backend config) may be used to get information on the rclone
configuration options.
This can be used to build user interfaces for displaying and setting any

.SS Specifying remotes to work on
Remotes are specified with the \f[V]fs=\f[R], \f[V]srcFs=\f[R],
\f[V]dstFs=\f[R] parameters depending on the command being used.
The parameters can be a string as per the rest of rclone, eg
\f[V]s3:bucket/path\f[R] or \f[V]:sftp:/my/dir\f[R].
They can also be specified as JSON blobs.
If specifying a JSON blob it should be a object mapping strings to
strings.
These values will be used to configure the remote.
There are 3 special values which may be set:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]type\f[R] - set to \f[V]type\f[R] to specify a remote called
\f[V]:type:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]_name\f[R] - set to \f[V]name\f[R] to specify a remote called
\f[V]name:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]_root\f[R] - sets the root of the remote - may be empty
One of \f[V]_name\f[R] or \f[V]type\f[R] should normally be set.
If the \f[V]local\f[R] backend is desired then \f[V]type\f[R] should be
set to \f[V]local\f[R].
If \f[V]_root\f[R] isn\[aq]t specified then it defaults to the root of
the remote.
For example this JSON is equivalent to \f[V]remote:/tmp\f[R]
{
    \[dq]_name\[dq]: \[dq]remote\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp\[dq]
}
And this is equivalent to
\f[V]:sftp,host=\[aq]example.com\[aq]:/tmp\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]sftp\[dq],
    \[dq]host\[dq]: \[dq]example.com\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp\[dq]
}
\f[R]
.fi
And this is equivalent to \f[V]/tmp/dir\f[R]
{
    \[dq]type\[dq]: \[dq]local\[dq],
    \[dq]_root\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/dir\[dq]
}
.SS Supported commands
.SS backend/command: Runs a backend command.
This takes the following parameters:
command - a string with the command name
fs - a remote name string e.g.
\[dq]drive:\[dq]
arg - a list of arguments for the backend command
opt - a map of string to string of options
Returns:
result - result from the backend command
Example:
rclone rc backend/command command=noop fs=. -o echo=yes -o blue -a path1 -a path2
.PP
Returns
{
    \[dq]result\[dq]: {
        \[dq]arg\[dq]: [
            \[dq]path1\[dq],
            \[dq]path2\[dq]
        ],
        \[dq]name\[dq]: \[dq]noop\[dq],
        \[dq]opt\[dq]: {
            \[dq]blue\[dq]: \[dq]\[dq],
            \[dq]echo\[dq]: \[dq]yes\[dq]
        }
    }
}
.PP
Note that this is the direct equivalent of using this \[dq]backend\[dq]
command:
rclone backend noop . -o echo=yes -o blue path1 path2
Note that arguments must be preceded by the \[dq]-a\[dq] flag
See the backend (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command
for more information.
\f[B]Authentication is required for this call.\f[R]
.SS cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache
Purge a remote from the cache backend.
Supports either a directory or a file.
Params: - remote = path to remote (required) - withData = true/false to
delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)
Eg
rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true
.SS cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks
Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.
The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check.
It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices.
The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]
start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to
fetch inclusive.
end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to fetch
exclusive.
Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back of
the file.
The value \[dq]-5:\[dq] represents the last 5 chunks of a file.
Some valid examples are: \[dq]:5,-5:\[dq] -> the first and last five
chunks \[dq]0,-2\[dq] -> the first and the second last chunk
\[dq]0:10\[dq] -> the first ten chunks
Any parameter with a key that starts with \[dq]file\[dq] can be used to
specify files to fetch, e.g.
rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye
File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote is
used on top of the cache.

.SS debug/set-block-profile-rate: Set runtime.SetBlockProfileRate for blocking profiling.
SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events
that are reported in the blocking profile.
The profiler aims to sample an average of one blocking event per rate
nanoseconds spent blocked.
To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1.
To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate <= 0.
After calling this you can use this to see the blocking profile:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block
\f[R]
.fi
Parameters:
.IP \[bu] 2
rate - int
.SS debug/set-gc-percent: Call runtime/debug.SetGCPercent for setting the garbage collection target percentage.
SetGCPercent sets the garbage collection target percentage: a collection
is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data
remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage.
SetGCPercent returns the previous setting.
The initial setting is the value of the GOGC environment variable at
startup, or 100 if the variable is not set.
This setting may be effectively reduced in order to maintain a memory
limit.
A negative percentage effectively disables garbage collection, unless
the memory limit is reached.
See https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMemoryLimit for more details.
Parameters:
.IP \[bu] 2
gc-percent - int
.SS debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction: Set runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction for mutex profiling.
SetMutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention events
that are reported in the mutex profile.
On average 1/rate events are reported.
The previous rate is returned.
To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0.
To just read the current rate, pass rate < 0.
(For n>1 the details of sampling may change.)
Once this is set you can look use this to profile the mutex contention:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex

Parameters:
.IP \[bu] 2
rate - int
Results:
.IP \[bu] 2
previousRate - int
.SS debug/set-soft-memory-limit: Call runtime/debug.SetMemoryLimit for setting a soft memory limit for the runtime.
SetMemoryLimit provides the runtime with a soft memory limit.
The runtime undertakes several processes to try to respect this memory
limit, including adjustments to the frequency of garbage collections and
returning memory to the underlying system more aggressively.
This limit will be respected even if GOGC=off (or, if SetGCPercent(-1)
is executed).
The input limit is provided as bytes, and includes all memory mapped,
managed, and not released by the Go runtime.
Notably, it does not account for space used by the Go binary and memory
external to Go, such as memory managed by the underlying system on
behalf of the process, or memory managed by non-Go code inside the same
process.
Examples of excluded memory sources include: OS kernel memory held on
behalf of the process, memory allocated by C code, and memory mapped by
syscall.Mmap (because it is not managed by the Go runtime).
A zero limit or a limit that\[aq]s lower than the amount of memory used
by the Go runtime may cause the garbage collector to run nearly
continuously.
However, the application may still make progress.
The memory limit is always respected by the Go runtime, so to
effectively disable this behavior, set the limit very high.
math.MaxInt64 is the canonical value for disabling the limit, but values
much greater than the available memory on the underlying system work
just as well.
See https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide for a detailed guide explaining the soft
memory limit in more detail, as well as a variety of common use-cases
and scenarios.
SetMemoryLimit returns the previously set memory limit.
A negative input does not adjust the limit, and allows for retrieval of
the currently set memory limit.
Parameters:
.IP \[bu] 2
mem-limit - int

\f[B]Authentication is required for this call.\f[R]
.SS serve/start: Create a new server
Create a new server with the specified parameters.
\f[V]type\f[R] - type of server: \f[V]http\f[R], \f[V]webdav\f[R],
\f[V]ftp\f[R], \f[V]sftp\f[R], \f[V]nfs\f[R], etc.
\f[V]fs\f[R] - remote storage path to serve
\f[V]addr\f[R] - the ip:port to run the server on, eg \[dq]:1234\[dq] or
\[dq]localhost:1234\[dq]
Other parameters are as described in the documentation for the relevant
rclone serve (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/) command line
options.
To translate a command line option to an rc parameter, remove the
leading \f[V]--\f[R] and replace \f[V]-\f[R] with \f[V]_\f[R], so
\f[V]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] becomes \f[V]vfs_cache_mode\f[R].
Note that global parameters must be set with \f[V]_config\f[R] and
\f[V]_filter\f[R] as described above.
Examples:
rclone rc serve/start type=nfs fs=remote: addr=:4321 vfs_cache_mode=full
rclone rc serve/start --json \[aq]{\[dq]type\[dq]:\[dq]nfs\[dq],\[dq]fs\[dq]:\[dq]remote:\[dq],\[dq]addr\[dq]:\[dq]:1234\[dq],\[dq]vfs_cache_mode\[dq]:\[dq]full\[dq]}\[aq]
This will give the reply
    \[dq]addr\[dq]: \[dq][::]:4321\[dq], // Address the server was started on

.SS vfs/forget: Forget files or directories in the directory cache.
This forgets the paths in the directory cache causing them to be re-read
from the remote when needed.
.PP
If no paths are passed in then it will forget all the paths in the
directory cache.
rclone rc vfs/forget
Otherwise pass files or dirs in as file=path or dir=path.
Any parameter key starting with file will forget that file and any
starting with dir will forget that dir, e.g.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/forget file=hello file2=goodbye dir=home/junk
\f[R]
.fi
This command takes an \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter.
If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use
then that VFS will be used.
If there is more than one VFS in use then the \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter
must be supplied.
.SS vfs/list: List active VFSes.
This lists the active VFSes.
It returns a list under the key \[dq]vfses\[dq] where the values are the
VFS names that could be passed to the other VFS commands in the
\[dq]fs\[dq] parameter.
.SS vfs/poll-interval: Get the status or update the value of the poll-interval option.
Without any parameter given this returns the current status of the
poll-interval setting.
When the interval=duration parameter is set, the poll-interval value is
updated and the polling function is notified.
Setting interval=0 disables poll-interval.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone rc vfs/poll-interval interval=5m
\f[R]
.fi
The timeout=duration parameter can be used to specify a time to wait for
the current poll function to apply the new value.
If timeout is less or equal 0, which is the default, wait indefinitely.
The new poll-interval value will only be active when the timeout is not
reached.
If poll-interval is updated or disabled temporarily, some changes might
not get picked up by the polling function, depending on the used remote.
This command takes an \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter.
If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use
then that VFS will be used.
If there is more than one VFS in use then the \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter
must be supplied.
.SS vfs/queue: Queue info for a VFS.
This returns info about the upload queue for the selected VFS.
This is only useful if \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] > off.
If you call it when the \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] is off, it will
return an empty result.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
    \[dq]queue\[dq]: // an array of files queued for upload
    [
        {
            \[dq]name\[dq]:      \[dq]file\[dq],   // string: name (full path) of the file,
            \[dq]id\[dq]:        123,      // integer: id of this item in the queue,
            \[dq]size\[dq]:      79,       // integer: size of the file in bytes
            \[dq]expiry\[dq]:    1.5       // float: time until file is eligible for transfer, lowest goes first
            \[dq]tries\[dq]:     1,        // integer: number of times we have tried to upload
            \[dq]delay\[dq]:     5.0,      // float: seconds between upload attempts
            \[dq]uploading\[dq]: false,    // boolean: true if item is being uploaded
        },
   ],
}
\f[R]
.fi
The \f[V]expiry\f[R] time is the time until the file is eligible for
being uploaded in floating point seconds.
This may go negative.
As rclone only transfers \f[V]--transfers\f[R] files at once, only the
lowest \f[V]--transfers\f[R] expiry times will have \f[V]uploading\f[R]
as \f[V]true\f[R].
So there may be files with negative expiry times for which
\f[V]uploading\f[R] is \f[V]false\f[R].
This command takes an \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter.
If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use
then that VFS will be used.
If there is more than one VFS in use then the \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter
must be supplied.
.SS vfs/queue-set-expiry: Set the expiry time for an item queued for upload.
Use this to adjust the \f[V]expiry\f[R] time for an item in the upload
queue.
You will need to read the \f[V]id\f[R] of the item using
\f[V]vfs/queue\f[R] before using this call.
You can then set \f[V]expiry\f[R] to a floating point number of seconds
from now when the item is eligible for upload.
If you want the item to be uploaded as soon as possible then set it to a
large negative number (eg -1000000000).
If you want the upload of the item to be delayed for a long time then
set it to a large positive number.
Setting the \f[V]expiry\f[R] of an item which has already has started
uploading will have no effect - the item will carry on being uploaded.
.PP
This will return an error if called with \f[V]--vfs-cache-mode\f[R] off
or if the \f[V]id\f[R] passed is not found.
.PP
This takes the following parameters
\f[V]fs\f[R] - select the VFS in use (optional)
\f[V]id\f[R] - a numeric ID as returned from \f[V]vfs/queue\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]expiry\f[R] - a new expiry time as floating point seconds
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]relative\f[R] - if set, expiry is to be treated as relative to the
current expiry (optional, boolean)
.PP
This returns an empty result on success, or an error.
.PP
This command takes an \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter.
If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use
then that VFS will be used.
If there is more than one VFS in use then the \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter
must be supplied.
.SS vfs/refresh: Refresh the directory cache.
.PP
This reads the directories for the specified paths and freshens the
directory cache.
.PP
If no paths are passed in then it will refresh the root directory.
rclone rc vfs/refresh
Otherwise pass directories in as dir=path.
Any parameter key starting with dir will refresh that directory, e.g.
rclone rc vfs/refresh dir=home/junk dir2=data/misc
If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree will
get refreshed.
This refresh will use --fast-list if enabled.
.PP
This command takes an \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter.
If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use
then that VFS will be used.
If there is more than one VFS in use then the \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter
must be supplied.
.SS vfs/stats: Stats for a VFS.
.PP
This returns stats for the selected VFS.
    // Status of the disk cache - only present if --vfs-cache-mode > off

        // ...
        \[dq]WriteWait\[dq]: 1000000000
This command takes an \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter.
If this parameter is not supplied and if there is only one VFS in use
then that VFS will be used.
If there is more than one VFS in use then the \[dq]fs\[dq] parameter
must be supplied.
.SS Accessing the remote control via HTTP
Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.
Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an
error.
The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to values.
All calls must made using POST.
The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST parameters
or by supplying \[dq]Content-Type: application/json\[dq] and a JSON blob
in the body.
There are examples of these below using \f[V]curl\f[R].
The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response.
This is formatted to be reasonably human-readable.
.SS Error returns
If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (e.g.
500) and the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error
object, e.g.
{
    \[dq]error\[dq]: \[dq]Expecting string value for key \[rs]\[dq]remote\[rs]\[dq] (was float64)\[dq],
    \[dq]input\[dq]: {
        \[dq]fs\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp\[dq],
        \[dq]remote\[dq]: 3
    },
    \[dq]status\[dq]: 400,
    \[dq]path\[dq]: \[dq]operations/rmdir\[dq]
}
The keys in the error response are:
error - error string
input - the input parameters to the call
status - the HTTP status code
path - the path of the call
.SS CORS
The sever implements basic CORS support and allows all origins for that.
The response to a preflight OPTIONS request will echo the requested
\[dq]Access-Control-Request-Headers\[dq] back.

See the net/http/pprof docs (https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/) for
more info on how to use the profiling and for a general overview see the
Go team\[aq]s blog post on profiling go
programs (https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs).
The profiling hook is zero overhead unless it is

.SH Overview of cloud storage systems
Each cloud storage system is slightly different.
Rclone attempts to provide a unified interface to them, but some
underlying differences show through.
.SS Features
Here is an overview of the major features of each cloud storage system.

⁸ Opendrive does not support creation of duplicate files using their web
client interface or other stock clients, but the underlying storage
platform has been determined to allow duplicate files, and it is
possible to create them with \f[V]rclone\f[R].
It may be that this is a mistake or an unsupported feature.
.PP
⁹ QingStor does not support SetModTime for objects bigger than 5 GiB.
.PP
¹⁰ FTP supports modtimes for the major FTP servers, and also others if
they advertised required protocol extensions.
See this (https://rclone.org/ftp/#modification-times) for more details.
.PP
¹¹ Internet Archive requires option \f[V]wait_archive\f[R] to be set to
a non-zero value for full modtime support.
.PP
¹² HiDrive supports its own custom
hash (https://static.hidrive.com/dev/0001).
It combines SHA1 sums for each 4 KiB block hierarchically to a single
top-level sum.
.PP
¹³ Uloz.to provides server-calculated MD5 hash upon file upload.
MD5 and SHA256 hashes are client-calculated and stored as metadata
fields.
.SS Hash
.PP
The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can
be specifically used with the \f[V]--checksum\f[R] flag in syncs and in
the \f[V]check\f[R] command.
.PP
To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.
.SS ModTime
.PP
Almost all cloud storage systems store some sort of timestamp on
objects, but several of them not something that is appropriate to use
for syncing.
E.g.
some backends will only write a timestamp that represents the time of
the upload.
To be relevant for syncing it should be able to store the modification
time of the source object.
If this is not the case, rclone will only check the file size by
default, though can be configured to check the file hash (with the
\f[V]--checksum\f[R] flag).
Ideally it should also be possible to change the timestamp of an
existing file without having to re-upload it.

.TE
.PP
Storage systems with a \f[V]-\f[R] in the ModTime column, means the
modification read on objects is not the modification time of the file
when uploaded.
It is most likely the time the file was uploaded, or possibly something
else (like the time the picture was taken in Google Photos).
.PP
Storage systems with a \f[V]R\f[R] (for read-only) in the ModTime
column, means the it keeps modification times on objects, and updates
them when uploading objects, but it does not support changing only the
modification time (\f[V]SetModTime\f[R] operation) without re-uploading,
possibly not even without deleting existing first.
Some operations in rclone, such as \f[V]copy\f[R] and \f[V]sync\f[R]
commands, will automatically check for \f[V]SetModTime\f[R] support and
re-upload if necessary to keep the modification times in sync.
Other commands will not work without \f[V]SetModTime\f[R] support, e.g.
\f[V]touch\f[R] command on an existing file will fail, and changes to
modification time only on a files in a \f[V]mount\f[R] will be silently
ignored.
.PP
Storage systems with \f[V]R/W\f[R] (for read/write) in the ModTime
column, means they do also support modtime-only operations.
.PP
Storage systems with \f[V]D\f[R] in the ModTime column means that the
following symbols apply to directories as well as files.
.SS Case Insensitive
.PP
If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, e.g.
\f[V]file.txt\f[R] and \f[V]FILE.txt\f[R].
If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn\[aq]t
possible.
.PP
This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system.
The symptom of this is that no matter how many times you run the sync it
never completes fully.
.PP
The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive depending
on OS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
.IP \[bu] 2
OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
sensitive
.IP \[bu] 2
Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
systems (e.g.
FAT formatted USB keys)
.PP
Most of the time this doesn\[aq]t cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.
.SS Duplicate files
.PP
If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.
.PP
This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the
\f[V]rclone dedupe\f[R] command to rename or remove duplicates.
.SS Restricted filenames
.PP
Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters
that are usable in file or directory names.
When \f[V]rclone\f[R] detects such a name during a file upload, it will
transparently replace the restricted characters with similar looking
Unicode characters.
To handle the different sets of restricted characters for different
backends, rclone uses something it calls encoding.
.PP
This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as
possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems
transparently.
.PP
The name shown by \f[V]rclone\f[R] to the user or during log output will
only contain a minimal set of replaced characters to ensure correct
formatting and not necessarily the actual name used on the cloud
storage.
.PP
This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing
\f[V]rclone\f[R] arguments.
For example, when uploading a file named \f[V]my file?.txt\f[R] to
Onedrive, it will be displayed as \f[V]my file?.txt\f[R] on the console,
but stored as \f[V]my file？.txt\f[R] to Onedrive (the \f[V]?\f[R] gets
replaced by the similar looking \f[V]？\f[R] character, the so-called
\[dq]fullwidth question mark\[dq]).
The reverse transformation allows to read a file
\f[V]unusual/name.txt\f[R] from Google Drive, by passing the name
\f[V]unusual／name.txt\f[R] on the command line (the \f[V]/\f[R] needs
to be replaced by the similar looking \f[V]／\f[R] character).
.SS Caveats
.PP
The filename encoding system works well in most cases, at least where
file names are written in English or similar languages.
You might not even notice it: It just works.
In some cases it may lead to issues, though.
E.g.
when file names are written in Chinese, or Japanese, where it is always
the Unicode fullwidth variants of the punctuation marks that are used.
.PP
On Windows, the characters \f[V]:\f[R], \f[V]*\f[R] and \f[V]?\f[R] are
examples of restricted characters.
If these are used in filenames on a remote that supports it, Rclone will
transparently convert them to their fullwidth Unicode variants
\f[V]＊\f[R], \f[V]？\f[R] and \f[V]：\f[R] when downloading to Windows,
and back again when uploading.
This way files with names that are not allowed on Windows can still be
stored.
.PP
However, if you have files on your Windows system originally with these
same Unicode characters in their names, they will be included in the
same conversion process.
E.g.
if you create a file in your Windows filesystem with name
\f[V]Test：1.jpg\f[R], where \f[V]：\f[R] is the Unicode fullwidth colon
symbol, and use rclone to upload it to Google Drive, which supports
regular \f[V]:\f[R] (halfwidth question mark), rclone will replace the
fullwidth \f[V]:\f[R] with the halfwidth \f[V]:\f[R] and store the file
as \f[V]Test:1.jpg\f[R] in Google Drive.
Since both Windows and Google Drive allows the name
\f[V]Test：1.jpg\f[R], it would probably be better if rclone just kept
the name as is in this case.
.PP
With the opposite situation; if you have a file named
\f[V]Test:1.jpg\f[R], in your Google Drive, e.g.
uploaded from a Linux system where \f[V]:\f[R] is valid in file names.
Then later use rclone to copy this file to your Windows computer you
will notice that on your local disk it gets renamed to
\f[V]Test：1.jpg\f[R].
The original filename is not legal on Windows, due to the \f[V]:\f[R],
and rclone therefore renames it to make the copy possible.
That is all good.
However, this can also lead to an issue: If you already had a
\f[I]different\f[R] file named \f[V]Test：1.jpg\f[R] on Windows, and
then use rclone to copy either way.
Rclone will then treat the file originally named \f[V]Test:1.jpg\f[R] on
Google Drive and the file originally named \f[V]Test：1.jpg\f[R] on
Windows as the same file, and replace the contents from one with the
other.
.PP
Its virtually impossible to handle all cases like these correctly in all
situations, but by customizing the encoding option, changing the set of
characters that rclone should convert, you should be able to create a
configuration that works well for your specific situation.
See also the
example (https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding-example-windows) below.
.PP
(Windows was used as an example of a file system with many restricted
characters, and Google drive a storage system with few.)
.SS Default restricted characters
.PP
The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.
.PP
When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character will
be escaped with the \f[V]‛\f[R] character to avoid ambiguous file names.
(e.g.
a file named \f[V]␀.txt\f[R] would shown as \f[V]‛␀.txt\f[R])
.PP
Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters, which
will be specified in the documentation for each backend.

.SS Invalid UTF-8 bytes
Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF-8 bytes as file
or directory names.
In this case all invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted
representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a
backend.
For example, the invalid byte \f[V]0xFE\f[R] will be encoded as
\f[V]‛FE\f[R].
A common source of invalid UTF-8 bytes are local filesystems, that store
names in a different encoding than UTF-8 or UTF-16, like latin1.
See the local filenames (https://rclone.org/local/#filenames) section
for details.
.SS Encoding option
Most backends have an encoding option, specified as a flag
\f[V]--backend-encoding\f[R] where \f[V]backend\f[R] is the name of the
backend, or as a config parameter \f[V]encoding\f[R] (you\[aq]ll need to
select the Advanced config in \f[V]rclone config\f[R] to see it).
This will have default value which encodes and decodes characters in
such a way as to preserve the maximum number of characters (see above).
However this can be incorrect in some scenarios, for example if you have
a Windows file system with Unicode fullwidth characters \f[V]＊\f[R],
\f[V]？\f[R] or \f[V]：\f[R], that you want to remain as those
characters on the remote rather than being translated to regular
(halfwidth) \f[V]*\f[R], \f[V]?\f[R] and \f[V]:\f[R].
The \f[V]--backend-encoding\f[R] flags allow you to change that.
You can disable the encoding completely with
\f[V]--backend-encoding Raw\f[R] or set \f[V]encoding = Raw\f[R] in the
config file.
Encoding takes a comma separated list of encodings.
You can see the list of all possible values by passing an invalid value
to this flag, e.g.
\f[V]--local-encoding \[dq]help\[dq]\f[R].
The command \f[V]rclone help flags encoding\f[R] will show you the
defaults for the backends.

.TE
¹ Encoding from NUL 0x00 to ␀ is always implicit except when using Raw.
It was previously incorrectly documented as disabling encoding, and to
maintain backward compatibility, its behavior has not been changed.
.SS Encoding example: FTP
To take a specific example, the FTP backend\[aq]s default encoding is
--ftp-encoding \[dq]Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot\[dq]
However, let\[aq]s say the FTP server is running on Windows and
can\[aq]t have any of the invalid Windows characters in file names.
You are backing up Linux servers to this FTP server which do have those
characters in file names.
So you would add the Windows set which are
Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot
to the existing ones, giving:
Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Del,RightSpace
This can be specified using the \f[V]--ftp-encoding\f[R] flag or using
an \f[V]encoding\f[R] parameter in the config file.
.SS Encoding example: Windows
As a nother example, take a Windows system where there is a file with
name \f[V]Test：1.jpg\f[R], where \f[V]：\f[R] is the Unicode fullwidth
colon symbol.
When using rclone to copy this to a remote which supports \f[V]:\f[R],
the regular (halfwidth) colon (such as Google Drive), you will notice
that the file gets renamed to \f[V]Test:1.jpg\f[R].
To avoid this you can change the set of characters rclone should convert
for the local filesystem, using command-line argument
\f[V]--local-encoding\f[R].
Rclone\[aq]s default behavior on Windows corresponds to
--local-encoding \[dq]Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot\[dq]
If you want to use fullwidth characters \f[V]：\f[R], \f[V]＊\f[R] and
\f[V]？\f[R] in your filenames without rclone changing them when
uploading to a remote, then set the same as the default value but
without \f[V]Colon,Question,Asterisk\f[R]:
--local-encoding \[dq]Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot\[dq]
Alternatively, you can disable the conversion of any characters with
\f[V]--local-encoding Raw\f[R].
Instead of using command-line argument \f[V]--local-encoding\f[R], you
may also set it as environment
variable (https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables)
\f[V]RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING\f[R], or
configure (https://rclone.org/docs/#configure) a remote of type
\f[V]local\f[R] in your config, and set the \f[V]encoding\f[R] option
there.
The risk by doing this is that if you have a filename with the regular
(halfwidth) \f[V]:\f[R], \f[V]*\f[R] and \f[V]?\f[R] in your cloud
storage, and you try to download it to your Windows filesystem, this
will fail.
These characters are not valid in filenames on Windows, and you have
told rclone not to work around this by converting them to valid
fullwidth variants.
.SS MIME Type
MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents using
a simple text classification, e.g.
\f[V]text/html\f[R] or \f[V]application/pdf\f[R].
Some cloud storage systems support reading (\f[V]R\f[R]) the MIME type
of objects and some support writing (\f[V]W\f[R]) the MIME type of
objects.
The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to HTTP
from the storage system.
If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (\f[V]R\f[R]) to
a remote which supports writing (\f[V]W\f[R]) then rclone will preserve
the MIME types.
Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the remote itself
may assign the MIME type.
.SS Metadata
Backends may or may support reading or writing metadata.
They may support reading and writing system metadata (metadata intrinsic
to that backend) and/or user metadata (general purpose metadata).
The levels of metadata support are

.TE
¹ Note Swift implements this in order to delete directory markers but it
doesn\[aq]t actually have a quicker way of deleting files other than
deleting them individually.
² Storj implements this efficiently only for entire buckets.
If purging a directory inside a bucket, files are deleted individually.
³ StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud
⁴ Use the \f[V]--sftp-copy-is-hardlink\f[R] flag to enable.
⁵ Use the \f[V]--onedrive-delta\f[R] flag to enable.
.SS Purge
This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in the
.SS Copy
Used when copying an object to and from the same remote.
This known as a server-side copy so you can copy a file without
downloading it and uploading it again.
It is used if you use \f[V]rclone copy\f[R] or \f[V]rclone move\f[R] if
the remote doesn\[aq]t support \f[V]Move\f[R] directly.
If the server doesn\[aq]t support \f[V]Copy\f[R] directly then for copy
operations the file is downloaded then re-uploaded.
.SS Move
Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote.
This is known as a server-side move of a file.
This is used in \f[V]rclone move\f[R] if the server doesn\[aq]t support
\f[V]DirMove\f[R].
If the server isn\[aq]t capable of \f[V]Move\f[R] then rclone simulates
it with \f[V]Copy\f[R] then delete.
If the server doesn\[aq]t support \f[V]Copy\f[R] then rclone will
download the file and re-upload it.
.SS DirMove
This is used to implement \f[V]rclone move\f[R] to move a directory if
possible.
If it isn\[aq]t then it will use \f[V]Move\f[R] on each file (which
falls back to \f[V]Copy\f[R] then download and upload - see
\f[V]Move\f[R] section).
.SS CleanUp
This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by
\f[V]rclone cleanup\f[R].
If the server can\[aq]t do \f[V]CleanUp\f[R] then
\f[V]rclone cleanup\f[R] will return an error.
‡‡ Note that while Box implements this it has to delete every file
individually so it will be slower than emptying the trash via the WebUI
.SS ListR
The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath a
directory quickly.
This enables the \f[V]--fast-list\f[R] flag to work.
See the rclone docs (https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more
details.
.SS StreamUpload
Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size in
advance.
This allows certain operations to work without spooling the file to
local disk first, e.g.
\f[V]rclone rcat\f[R].
.SS MultithreadUpload
Some remotes allow transfers to the remote to be sent as chunks in
parallel.
If this is supported then rclone will use multi-thread copying to
transfer files much faster.
.SS LinkSharing
Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link
that allows others to access them, even if they don\[aq]t have an
account on the particular cloud provider.
.SS About
Rclone \f[V]about\f[R] prints quota information for a remote.
Typical output includes bytes used, free, quota and in trash.
If a remote lacks about capability \f[V]rclone about remote:\f[R]returns
an error.
Backends without about capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount, or use policy \f[V]mfs\f[R] (most free space) as a member
of an rclone union remote.
See rclone about command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
.SS EmptyDir
The remote supports empty directories.
See Limitations (https://rclone.org/bugs/#limitations) for details.
Most Object/Bucket-based remotes do not support this.
.SH Global Flags
This describes the global flags available to every rclone command split
into groups.
